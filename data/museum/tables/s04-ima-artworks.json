Devoid of people, Hopper\u2019s landscapes have an abandoned atmosphere that echoes the loneliness and isolation             of his urban scenes.             This canvas, named after the East Coast railroad line, was painted during the Depression and depicts a             landscape and desolate house along the railroad tracks. The prominence of the tracks suggests Hopper\u2019s             recurring theme of transience and the solitude of the traveler.", "The colorful patterns and glowing sunshine are signature elements of Frieseke's work.             Frieseke's paintings of female figures made him one of America's most popular Impressionists.             The artist spent his summers painting at Giverny, France near the home of French Impressionist Claude Monet.", "This cityscape features the State House, the brilliantly lighted Park Theatre, and Washington             Street's bustling commercial life.  The tower of the old Marion County Courthouse can be seen in the             distance.

This peaceful scene was painted on the artist's farm in Connecticut.", "The intricate network of trellis, railing and awning are woven into an ordered composition.             Strokes of brilliant color are applied with a sensitivity to light and shade acquired from regular outdoor             painting.             Sharman's current obscurity is hard to understand considering this beautiful scene.", "This is one of three paintings that Garber produced in the late 1920s near Brownsburgh,             Pennsylvania.             Garber liked the  stark quality  of the setting, and the work's spareness and simplicity creates a sense of             mystery.             Garber, an Indiana native, was closely associated with the New Hope art colony in Bucks County,             Pennsylvania.", "Garber recreated the quarry's raw, craggy features adding an Impressionist play of light across             its richly textured surface.             The quarries near the artist's home in Bucks County are an important theme in his work.             Born in Indiana, Garber became a teacher at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.", "This work exhibits a careful balancing of form and color.  The flow of the red tam into the green             scarf enlivens the simplified volumes of the face.             Kroll's traditional approach was at odds with the modernist artist's desire to experiment with new styles             and methods.", "This painting of professional model Edna Smith is typical of Henri's ability to capture his             subject's spirit.             The rich hues of this image show Henri's use of Hardesty Maratta's color system.             Henri is known primarily for his portraits and figure studies.", "Frieseke is known for his juxtaposition of varied colors and patterns.

Beaux\u2019s success as a portrait painter rested on her keen sense of color, texture, and composition, as well             as her ability to capture the essence of the sitter.               Mrs. Addison C. Harris was one of the first presidents of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the             forerunner of the IMA. Mrs. Harris is posed in a relaxed yet dignified manner in front of an alpine scene,             probably a painted screen belonging to the artist.", "Bronco Buster exhibits the artist's flair for depicting dramatic action.             This sculpture became so popular that a number of fakes have been made.             In addition to being a painter and sculptor, Remington was a rancher, part owner of a saloon, and a cowboy.", "Poppies gives the effect of having been painted quickly and directly before the subject.             At a distance, the choppy strokes and daubs of color resolve into a luminous floral landscape.             Painted in France in 1888, this canvas is one of the earliest American responses to French Impressionism.", "Davies\u2019 paintings exude a dream-like quality of detachment from the everyday world.             In Across the Harbor Davies painted a group of female figures, posing their stylized forms in the             frieze-like composition he favored.             The color scheme and abrupt change of scale heighten the painting\u2019s sense of mystery.", "From 1905 until 1910 Kent lived on Monhegan Island, Maine, where he painted this scene.             Despite the relatively serene conditions, Kent imbued the landscape with a sense of drama and magnitude.             The broad brushstrokes showcase the influence of Kent\u2019s teachers William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri.", "The loose energetic brushwork in the woman's blouse and hair are elements of the Impressionist             style.             Tarbell was a leading member of the Boston School of painters, known for their pictures of young women             engaged in domestic activities.", "Love Song presents the artist's major theme, the different stages of life.  Here, a young girl             wistfully listens to music played by two elderly men.  The painting's title is printed on the music sheet.              An old map suggests rural America.             Rockwell, America's premiere illustrator, created more than 300 Saturday Evening Post covers, capturing the             daily lives of average Americans.", "Delaney combines aggressive brushwork, exaggerated poses and a tendency toward caricature to             suggest the group's animated conversation.             Delaney is shown with his back to the viewer talking to a man believed to be the Abstract Expressionist             painter Jackson Pollock.", "Johnson's style consists of flat, simplified patterns presented in a na\u00efve manner with a touch of             humor.             The artist pokes fun at the army's regimentation and discipline.             Pochoir is a stencil technique characterized by crisp lines and brilliant colors.", "Paxton, who was known for his fine draftsmanship, uses diffused light to soften contours in a             manner similar to Impressionism.             His favorite subjects were female figures posed in elegant interiors.             Paxton was a member of the Boston School that flourished during the early 20th century.", "Painted in a fluid Impressionist manner, this composition is executed using broken color in a             harmonious balance of blues, pinks, lavenders, and yellows.             Ritman spent almost two decades in Giverny, where he came under the influence of the Impressionist style.", "The figure\u2019s dress provides a blank canvas for Benson\u2019s brushstrokes in dazzling white, pink, and             violet, accented by the blue and violet shadows typical of Impressionism.             The model is the artist\u2019s daughter Eleanor, who often joined her mother and sisters in posing for Benson\u2019s             outdoor works around Wooster Farm, their summer retreat in Maine.             Benson was a key figure in Boston\u2019s art scene, both as a highly successful artist and director of the Museum             of Fine Art\u2019s school. Like colleagues Edmund Tarbell and William Paxton, his purest Impressionist efforts             are depictions of women and children in sun-drenched landscapes.", "Indianapolis native William Scott studied in France with the celebrated African American artist             Henry O. Tanner.             Etaples, Tanner\u2019s summer residence, was the subject of several of Scott\u2019s paintings.             Tanner\u2019s influence is evident in the blue-green palette, subdued tonality and dramatic light.", "With its rapid brushwork and tilted perspective, this painting summons a strong sense of motion.             Hartley worked in France in the late 1920s, where he produced numerous still lifes.             The artist was a member of the Stieglitz Group of American Modernist artists.", "Adams' skillful drawing technique is visible in the careful balance of horizontals and verticals.             This sunlit canvas is brighter than the dark scenarios preferred by the Royal Academy in Munich, where Adams             studied in the 1880s.             Wash Day, painted in Munich, is the first work Adams sent to America for exhibition.", "The woman kisses the sword of her officer, dedicating it to a noble cause.             The symbolism of the gray-blue color scheme must have been obvious to the artist\u2019s postwar audience.              This canvas recalled the romantic spirit in which many men went off to battle.", "Higgins exhibits the influence of cubism in his use of geometric shapes enhanced by strong             contrasts of light and dark.             The artist was affected by the 1913 New York armory show, where he came in contact with European and             American Modernism.", "Chase relished painting his family, and the pictures of his wife and daughters are among his most             memorable canvases.             This portrait of Chase's daughter Dorothy is one of several full-length images with subdued color schemes             and unadorned backgrounds that he painted between 1886 and 1902.", "The dark, brooding tone is typical of Whittredge's German work.             Summer Pastorale is probably a compilation of two views of Kallenfels recorded in sketches.             In 1849 Whittredge traveled to D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany and spent time painting in the Harz Mountains.", "In this canvas, Roszak combined geometric abstraction, Surrealism, and his fascination with             technology to create visual descriptions of sound.             Roszak, a skilled violinist, depicts the act of music making and the machine capable of recording it.", "Morning at Grand Manan is a prime example of Luminism, a style characterized by tranquil             landscapes, barely visible brushstrokes, precisely rendered detail and glowing light.             Bricher favored working along the North Atlantic coast, including Grand Manan Island, a summer resort in New             Brunswick, Canada.", "Manship achieves a witty interpretation of the classical myth of Europa, abducted by Zeus who             transformed himself into a bull to carry her across the sea.             The rhythmic composition sets horizontal against vertical and speed versus stillness, as the bull's horns,             tail and legs oppose Europa's upright stance.", "Born in Pennsylvania, Benjamin West studied painting in Rome in his early twenties and moved to             England in 1763, where he remained for the rest of his career. The setting for this landscape is the Queen's             Lodge in the Great Park at Windsor, where woodcutters are shown making a clearing to provide a  view.  Such             vistas were an essential part of 18th-century English landscape design. The landscape was painted the same             year West began work on a major cycle of decorations for the chapel at Windsor Castle.", "Hunt\u2019s studies in Europe in the 1840s and \u201850s brought him into contact with Jean Fran\u00e7ois Millet             and the Barbizon School.             Hunt returned to America in 1855 and settled in Boston in 1862.             The Renaissance costume of this figure suggests a growing interest in that historical period, one that was             also reflected in furniture and other decorative arts of the 1860s and \u201870s.", "The Olive Grove was probably painted on the Greek isle of Corfu during one of Sargent's trips to             the Mediterrean.              The image depicts a group local people gathering olives in baskets.             Sargent was a noted portrait painter during the late 19th century, and turned increasing to landscape             painting in the early 20th century.", "Twinkling lights on the distant shore mixed with dark tonal harmonies create a moody twilight             landscape.             The expressive, linear brushwork may have been derived from the study of Asian painting.             Dabo described his landscapes as \u201cpretexts for beautiful color arrangements.\u201d", "Duveneck opened a school in Polling, Bavaria where he trained Americans who became known as the             \u201cDuveneck Boys.\u201d             Polling Landscape exhibits principles of the Munich Academy\u2019s teaching and the French Barbizon             artists-strong brushwork, the manipulation of dark tonalities, and a sketch-like quality.", "Morse painted Finley in the typical dark tonalities and plain background favored for Colonial             portraits.             Attention is drawn to the sitter's face through the use of light and the white shirt collar.             Morse is best known as the inventor of the telegraph, but he was also an established artist.", "The radical manipulation of perspective and scale, and the strong but elegant contours of the             bone, exemplify O'Keeffe's genius for capturing the essential forms of nature.             In 1929 O'Keeffe began to summer in New Mexico, where the colors, shapes, and vistas of the Southwest became             central to her work.", "Like all her magnified views, the hills of O'Keeffe's New Mexico landscapes threaten to burst the             bounds of the frame.             O'Keeffe painted this canvas during a trip to a desolate region of New Mexico.             The artist was a modernist painter associated with Alfred Stieglitz and his New York galleries.", "The Pioneers resemble a style of British landscape painting known as  picturesque,  which features             images such as the shadowy valley, rugged woodcutters, twisted trees and romantic stone ruins.             English-born Shaw painted the branches and leaves with a delicate touch.", "The statue's elegant face and poised bearing have the grace and dignity of the neo-classical             ideal.             Rogers was a member of the neo-classical movement considered to be America's first native school of             sculpture.             Ruth was an Old Testament heroine who left her birthplace and settled in Israel, uttering the words,              Whither thou goest, I will go. ", "This balanced composition set against a dark background reflects Chase's Munich training.             Famous for his rapid technique, Chase claimed he could return at least one fish to market fresh enough to be             sold.", "This scene is typical of Hudson River School painting in its inclusion of small figures, misty             mountains, sun-dappled shore, and expansive vista.             Duncanson produced a series of Scottish landscapes stimulated by his travels and the literature of Sir             Walter Scott.", "Louisa seems an assured, engaging model in her fashionable empire-cut gown.             Louisa was the daughter of Indianapolis banker Stoughton Fletcher and wife of Hoosier author Booth             Tarkington, whom she divorced in 1911.             The artist and Louisa were friends with a mutual interest in art.", "Acrobat accentuates male strength and is a study of the body in balance.             Lachaise's interest in unconventional poses and distortion of forms links him to the Modernist Movement.             The artist is best known for his sculptures of voluptuous female figures.", "In the hazy, vaporous atmosphere of this painting, Inness tried to meld the natural and spiritual             worlds.             Inness followed the teachings of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, who theorized that objects in the             material world exist in a parallel spiritual realm.", "The lighter tonalities and tighter brushwork are characteristic of Chase's early work.             Based on the strength of his still lifes, a group of St. Louis businessmen sponsored Chase's education at             the Munich Royal Academy in 1872.             Although flowers occasionally reappear in the artist's output, his reputation as a still life painter was             secured by his bravura depictions of fish.", "This canvas is perhaps the only panoramic underwater scene in 19th-century American art, and it is             the aquatic equivalent of a Hudson River School landscape.             Moran may have been inspired by underwater exploration related to the laying of the first successful             telegraph cable in 1858.", "Gilbert Stuart             Portrait of A Family, ca. 1783 - 1793             oil on canvas             50 x 40 in.             Gift of Mrs. Herman C. Krannert              Learn More             Debt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life.  Born in             North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took             him to Scotland, but his mentor\u2019s death forced Stuart back to America.  During the Revolutionary War, he             returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West.  As success came, so did debt which             forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded             portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using             any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important             political figures.  One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the \u201cAthenaeum Head\u201d currently             on the dollar bill.             In this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British             portraiture.  The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boy\u2019s             jacket move the viewer\u2019s eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures. The woman is wearing a simple,             elegant, robe \u00e0 l\u2019anglaise, a gown favored by portrait painters of the period.  The woman\u2019s hair is lightly             powdered and fashionably styled in the coiffure \u00e0 l'h\u00e9risson, or \u201chedgehog,\u201d in which the hair was cut short             in the front, frizzed to the ends and then brushed up away from the face.

The Rainbow belongs to the dramatic series of storm scenes painted by Inness during the late 1870s.", "The sitter\u2019s expressive right hand reveals that the artist had a solid grounding in draftsmanship             and modeling.             This portly man was an actor stranded in Paris who posed for painters between acting jobs.             The portrait was exhibited in Paris in 1908, where Booth Tarkington purchased it.", "The child's serious expression reflects the mid-19th century concept of children as small adults.             The rugged setting is a reminder of the frontier conditions that existed in Indiana in the 1850s.             Hegler received a commission from Dr. Lewis Lyons of Attica to paint his daughter Alice.", "Church painted panoramic vistas of scenes from New England to South America, but in this canvas he             offers a symbolic image of America during the Civil War.             The 31-star flag of the Union flutters amidst the smoke of battle as a symbol of Church's belief in the             eventual triumph of the Union.", "This painting's introspective mood, harmonious colors and peaceful, open scene are prime examples             of American Tonalism.              The artist wanted his lanscapes to be evocations of states of mind.             Tryon's favorite subject was a stand of trees in a barren field at twilight.", "Patches of raw canvas, daubs of thick paint and frenzied brushwork convey the turbulence of the             stormy sea.             Marin is best known for his watercolors, but his oils also exude the dynamic power of nature.             The artist created landscapes inspired by cubism, and a sensitivity to nature's rhythms.", "In Bradford's day, icebergs were seen as symbols of the perpetual process of formation and             destruction, and the icy equivalents of mountains.             The whaler and fishing vessels add a human presence that tempers the awesome scale of nature.", "Thayer\u2019s image of his daughter\u2019s 15-year-old friend embodies the natural beauty of young             womanhood.             Her tousled hair, rough blouse and open gaze suggest a mixture of innocence and sensuality.             The Italian Renaissance-style frame was chosen by the artist.", "In his sculpture, Rubins sought harmonious proportions and a pensive quality that exhibits his             knowledge of classical sculpture and his skill at modeling the figure.             Rubins studied at the American Academy in Rome before joining the faculty at the Herron Art School in             Indianapolis.", "The luminosity and color harmonies in this painting exemplify Steele's impressionist style.             The title refers to the white, gauzy veil that covers grapes at harvest time.             Painted at Vernon, Indiana, The Bloom of the Grape is Steele's best-known landscape.", "This canvas contains the broken light and color of the Impressionists, but its modulated hues             create a quiet, contemplative mood.             Brown served as professor of art at Stanford University during the time this work was painted.", "In the late 1920s Hartley painted in southern France where Post-Impressionist Paul C\u00e9zanne had             lived.             Melons reflects C\u00e9zanne's methods and approach in the parallel brushstrokes and the mountainous forms of the             cloth.", "Stuart endows his subject with character and elegance through sheer technical facility, which is             evident in Walker's exquisitely rendered flesh tones and lifelike eyes.             This portrait was painted on the occasion of the sitter's marriage.", "The setting sun, luminous mists, and tidy farm buildings present a romantic image of man and             nature in harmony.             This canvas is an idealized composition that combines motifs from several different locales.             Cropsey was widely acclaimed for his autumn landscapes.", "The artist has transformed a haphazard arrangement of apples into a stable, pyramidal design,             reflective of Paul C\u00e9zanne's use of solid, geometric forms.             Kuhn helped organize the New York Armory Show in 1913, the famous exhibition that introduced modern art to             the American public.", "This elegant column can be read as a skyscraper or an abstract arrangement of geometric forms.             The sculpture's rigid geometry is tempered by the juxtaposition of steel, brass and marble.             Storrs was interested in the raw materials of industry, and towering skyscrapers.", "The path, covered wagon and pioneers, suggest the future cultivation of this landscape.             The unspoiled wilderness becomes both a haven for spiritual contemplation and a Promised Land to be settled             by the pioneers.             Durand was a leader of the Hudson River School.", "Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Winslow Homer worked for years as an illustrator before taking             night classes in drawing and painting at the National Academy of Design in New York City.               During the early 1870s Homer explored a single theme in different media.  The oil painting The Boat Builders             relates to a series of illustrations, prints and drawings devoted to the shipbuilding industry of Essex,             Massachusetts and the maritime community of Gloucester, Massachusetts.              Homer subtly connects the real nautical world with the children\u2019s play by overlapping the toy boat and             sailing ship on the horizon. Through their play the two boys may have been preparing for their future             careers as fishermen, sailors or shipbuilders.", "This is O'Keeffe's largest and most ambitious floral work, with her signature emphasis on size and             contour.             In 1936 Elizabeth Arden commissioned O'Keeffe to paint Jimson Weed for the exercise room of her New York             spa.", "The Passion of Christ Series established Bearden as an abstract artist.             This painting creates a celebratory mood of rebirth and redemption.             Bearden grew up in Harlem and was influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.", "Washington is elegantly attired in military garb holding his sword as a reference to his role as             an officer.             This scene shows Washington at Princeton, New Jersey where the revolutionary army won a victory in 1777.", "Reflections features the circular shapes, natural forms and feathered brushstrokes that are             hallmarks of Dove's style.             Dove, an artist known for his humor and whimsy, said that this painting was about reflections from             headlights on the windshield of a car.             The artist was a key member of the Stieglitz Group of modernist painters and a pioneer of abstraction.", "Here, a group of Potawatomi Indians gather next to the Wabash River. The figures are posed in a             casual setting, reflecting Winter\u2019s goal to record the daily life and customs of these people.             Winter was born in England and came to America in 1830 to study in New York. In 1837 he moved to Logansport,             Indiana.", "Ritman's interest in decorative patterning is evident in the mixture of floral prints with stripes             that contrast with the buzzing confusion of nature seen through the open window.             Ritman, a Chicago artist, settled in Giverny, France near the home of Claude Monet, in 1909.", "Here pastel colors contrast with patches of darker hues to convey a cool soggy day.             April may depict a stretch of the Harlem River in Washington Heights, New York.             Lawson was the only Impressionist and pure landscapist among The Eight, a group of artists who opposed             traditional styles of painting.", "In this painting, Prendergast handled watercolor with his characteristic freedom, wielding thin             washes in loosely knit strokes and allowing the white paper to become part of the composition. Contemporary             critics noted that Prendergast\u2019s loose style fit his leisurely subjects.", "Cecil Head derived his subject matters from views of downtown Indianapolis.             Builders presents bricklayers and masons constructing an apartment building at Tenth Street and Pennsylvania             Avenue.             The complex color harmonies combined with strong contrasts are typical of the artist\u2019s sense of color.", "The colorful palette of this painting is in keeping with the gaiety and theatricality of the             subject.             New Year's Shooter was painted about the time of the exhibition of The Eight, a group of artists who opposed             traditional painting formulas based on careful drawing and modeling.", "This canvas depicts Meredith Hare.  His mother asked for a formal portrait.  Bellows complied, but             he also painted this more casual likeness.  Mrs. Hare could not decide between the two, so she took neither.             Bellows was a member of the Ashcan School, whose artists preferred unglamorized images.", "The artist captures the low and rolling, flat terrain of the Shinnecock countryside, with its             occasional tree, sand dunes, and dwarfed bushes.             Chase established America's first summer school of art at Shinnecock Hills, Long Island, where he painted             some of his most Impressionist landscapes.", "During Holy Week thousands of pilgrims travel to the sacred ground of Chimayo, a historic             sanctuary known as a healing place in the mountains of northern New Mexico.             Here the Sangre de Cristo Mountains envelop the pilgrims on their Holy Week journey.", "Feathered, interwoven brushstrokes in a vibrant palette of rich pastels swathe both figure and             landscape, thus unifying the composition.             During the late 1880s Reid followed his Boston classmates Frank Benson and Edmund Tarbell to Paris for study             at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. While Benson and Tarbell began exploring Impressionist ideas in France, Reid only             fell under the style\u2019s influence after returning to the US in 1889.             Best known for murals painted in a decorative style, Reid displayed an Impressionist point of view in easel             paintings like this portrait of his wife. He also created stained-glass windows, another indication of his             attraction to the effects of sunlight.", "This elaborate pastoral landscape with its background mountains shows the artist's skill at             depicting a variety of foliage touched by autumn colors and bright sunlight.             Brook in Summer is probably a composite of sketches of the Indianapolis countryside and views invented by             Cox.", "The elusive qualities of sunshine and breezes are captured in Calypso\u2019s flowing classical garb,             the billowy clouds and brilliantly colored flowers.             In Greek mythology Calypso was the sea nymph who saved Odysseus from a shipwreck.             Hitchcock worked in Holland and became one of America\u2019s leading expatriate painters.", "Jacob Cox was trained as a tinsmith, a trade that he followed for a time even after he began             painting in the early 1840s.             Cox received many portrait commissions but found more personal enjoyment in painting landscapes.             The carefully depicted pet and the image of leisure activity combine to create an engaging impression of the             boy\u2019s personality and interests.", "Bierstadt's subject is the vast scale and awe-inspiring effect of fog-shrouded mountains and             wilderness.  Though it is entitled Alaska, the actual site may be in British Columbia or Washington.             Bierstadt searched America's wildest regions for his romantic vistas.", "This panoramic view captures the atmosphere and luminous colors of the Catskills in autumn.             The light-filled sky reflected in the water may be a metaphor for spiritual and physical harmony.             A tiny image of a boat in the center of the lake leaves a trail of ripples in the water.", "The dark tonalities, backlighting, and even the composition relate to Steele's Bavarian scenes.             In 1885, Pleasant Run defined the eastern and southern limits of Indianapolis.             Painted a few months after Steele returned from Germany, this work is a masterpiece of his Munich manner.", "Riley is posed in a contemplative manner holding a book to suggest his profession as a writer.             In 1898 Riley delivered a poetry reading to benefit the Art Association of Indianapolis, the forerunner of             the Indianapolis Museum of Art.", "Harrison is identified with an American style called Tonalism.             In Tonalist paintings a single hue dominates the composition, which evokes the nuances of light and             atmosphere.             The softened details and unpeopled terrain exhibit Tonalism\u2019s quiet, meditative state.", "Addicks appears rapt in thought or perhaps preoccupied by an absorbing melody.             Pianist Stanley Addicks belonged to the circle of friends who provided most of Eakins\u2019 subjects.             Eakins is known for his realism and sensitivity to the psychological aspects of portraiture.", "Here the sun sets over the rich, green, prairie landscape.  A bright orange orb suggests the end             of a hot summer day.             This painting is characteristic of the flatness and horizontality of the landscape.             Prairie Dell is an area in Prairie Township, not far from Adams's home in Muncie, Indiana.", "Forsyth focuses on the timeworn quality of the woman's hands and facial features.             This canvas exemplifies the Munich Schools' dark tonality and bravura brushwork.             In 1882 William Forsyth traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy.", "The subdued tones typical of the Munich School are applied with a freedom of execution unusual for             the period.             This broad landscape exemplifies Currier\u2019s bold, emotional response to the powers of nature.             Currier studied in Munich and sometimes painted the dark moors of nearby Dachau.", "Concretion is an abstract work, based upon the relationship of colored forms in an undefined             space.  The lively organic shapes maintain a rhythmic and harmonic balance.             The artist felt that painting could express a universal language, not dependent on subject matter or             representational images.", "This nude figure of a child surrounded by a base of frogs was inspired by children Scudder             observed in Italy.             Scudder was one of the premier artists of garden sculpture of her era.             Frog Fountain is Scudder's best-known work.", "This still life is painted with Forsyth's deft brushwork and dramatic flair for color.             Forsyth was a member of Indiana's impressionist painters known as the Hoosier Group.             The artist was the primary instructor at the Herron Art School in Indianapolis for almost 30 years.", "James Peale's likeness of Revolutionary War officer Thomas Humphrey Cushing is typical of his best             technique. Peale passed his skills on to his daughter Anna whose portrait is similar to her father's natural             flesh tones and firm drawing style.             Miniature portraits have been used as mementos since ancient times.", "James Peale's likeness of Revolutionary War officer Thomas Humphrey Cushing is typical of his best             technique.

In 1837 he moved to             Logansport, Indiana.", "In this landscape Adams pursues the impressionist goal of capturing the light and atmosphere of a             specific moment.             Thornberry's Pasture is in Brooklyn, Indiana a few miles southwest of Indianapolis.             Adams was the first painting instructor at the John Herron Art Institute.", "Hilliard was a versatile painter of portraits, landscapes, still lifes and animals.             The slightly unbalanced, casual arrangement of the flowers suggests Hilliard was aware of Japanese design.             Hilliard came to Madison, Indiana from Auburn, New York at age twenty.  He arrived in Indianapolis ten years             later and then went to Boston and Europe.", "The subject of this painting resembles a nativity scene with Mary, baby Jesus, and Joseph in a             landscape setting.             Glessing was a painter of theatrical scenery and landscapes.             When this scene was painted, the artist was in Indianapolis decorating the Metropolitan Theatre, which later             became the Park.", "The artist's mother was the first guest and subject of the first portrait the artist painted in             his new studio and summer residence at Shinnecock, Long Island, in 1892.             The lace cap was added by Chase to cover a spot he had overlooked, but its delicate texture and bow also             soften the sitter's features.             Chase taught the first outdoor school of landscape painting at Shinnecock.", "Couse is best known for his intimate images of Native Americans in quiet repose.             The artist's paint strokes set up a rhythmic flow, which moves throughout the work.             Tradition holds that the Taos Indians were created out of the sacred waters of Blue Lake.", "Fechin developed a dramatic style consisting of vigorous brush strokes and vivid colors.             The artist loved the somber forests near his home in Russia and found their equivalent in the New Mexico             Plateau, where he settled in 1927.             The Pueblo Indians rekindled Fechin's interest in the culture and heritage of native peoples.", "Portia's fashionable hat, with its veil stretched tightly over her face and head, is in keeping             with Du Bois' tendency to reduce human forms to a few simplified shapes.             The sitter is dressed in a style that echoes her high social standing.             Du Bois was an art critic as well as an artist.", "This ambitious portrait presents the members of the Hoosier group, (from left to right) T. C.             Steele, Otto Stark, J. Ottis Adams and William Forsyth.  Richard Gruelle had died seven years earlier.             The artists are posed as if they were choosing paintings for an art exhibition.", "Eugene Ullman's style resembles that of his teachers, William Merritt Chase and James Abbott             McNeill Whistler.             In this painting the artist combines the dark tonalities of the figure and background to create an elegant             portrait.              Ullman spent most of his career in France.", "This painting is an Indian-style version of the Oriental harem woman, a voluptuous figure             reclining in luxurious surroundings.             The title gives the picture a touch of anecdotal humor.             Russell and Frederick Remington were the most renowned artists of the American West.", "This is an idealized portrait of a seventeen-year-old Indian boy who later became Chief of the             Taos Pueblo.             The boy is shown drying a bird's brain to create a talisman that will guarantee his future success.             Sharp documented Indian tribal life and ritual.", "Remington portrayed this horse and rider with a keen sense of drama, capturing the perils of             descending down a steep mountain slope.             This scene is portrayed as realistically as the sculptor's art permits.             The West's most daring explorers, trappers, and traders were known as mountain men.", "The foreboding quality of the forest and the three tiny spotlighted figures, frozen in poses of             fright and struggle, suggest the aftermath of a disaster.             The use of the explosive material pyroxylin, a fast drying duco, is in keeping with the artist's image of             forces beyond man's control.", "This figure exemplifies the straightforward unidealized portraits favored by Henri.             The woman in this canvas lived off the coast of Ireland, where Henri and his wife vacationed.             Henri led the Ashcan School, a group of artists who focused on gritty urban realism.", "The seated half-length figure, plain background and emphasis on hands and face are elements of             early American portraits.             Hoosier artist Barton Hays began his career tinting photographs and painting over enlarged prints.", "In this painting, two soothsayers of ancient Greece, called Bacidae, study the entrails of a bird             for signs of the future.             Dodson's work is based on dramatic themes from the Bible, history and classical mythology.", "Although Dines learned to paint from his Danish-American father, Emile, both artists produced             tonal arrangements inspired by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and 17th-century Dutch masters.             In this painting, Whistler's influence is especially apparent in the artist's use of a limited palette of             yellow, black and green, and the simplified composition.", "The sitter is posed in a romantic setting wearing fashionable attire, but Peale did not soften her             intense gaze or prominent nose.             Helen and her husband founded McLean Seminary, a girls' school in Indianapolis.             Peale was a member of a Philadelphia family of prominent American painters.", "With its emphasis on profile and clean geometric shapes, Indian Hunter exhibits Manship's             enthusiasm for archaic Greek sculpture.             The sculpture's rhythmic contours create the sensation of movement.             Manship is best known for his gilded statue of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center in New York.", "The fluid brush and broken color, as well as the birds-eye view perspective, all indicate             Goodwin's debt to Impressionism.             The subject refers to one of the many parades held to raise funds for America's war efforts.             This canvas is a view of Arlington Street as it borders Boston Gardens Park.", "Famous for his mobiles and stabiles, the sculptor Alexander Calder was also a notable painter.             Calder's work displays a free and whimsical spirit.             The two keyhole-shaped vibrantly colored, geometric figures transform a simple design into a dream image.", "The portrait is an essay in subtle earth tones accented by the woman\u2019s long dangling earring.             The simple flourish that suggests the figure\u2019s right hand demonstrates Bell\u2019s adept brushwork.             This figure study exemplifies Bell\u2019s early work and Munich School training.", "To emphasize the untouched quality of the American wilderness, Codman dramatized the Indian's             prowess in his native environment.             This landscape surrounded by trees and mountains is a composite of specific and imagined forms, some drawn             from prints and literary sources.", "The sitter's dress and coiffure reflect the new American aristocracy's desire to legitimize itself             through association with historical styles of ancient Greece and Rome.             Stuart's portraits of George Washington and Federalist families in Philadelphia and Washington secured his             place in history.", "The stylized hair and soft rounded forms are in harmony with the images of the sea, the goddess,             and Art Deco sculpture of the 1920s and 1930s.             This small bronze figure is tied to the mythological goddess of love and her birth from the foam of the sea.", "De Luce was a noted portrait and genre painter.             An Anxious Mother is a typical Victorian scene of a child at play.             This is the first painting acquired by the museum after it was founded in 1883.", "This scene is composed of flat, simplified forms, vibrant colors and geometric patterns.             Lawrence, one of the nation's most important African American artists, excelled in making paintings and             prints of contemporary life.             During the Depression Lawrence focused on the tenement house in New York's Harlem.", "Women in a sunlit landscape framed by a large, vividly patterned Japanese parasol, exemplify             Miller's expressionist technique.             Miller was one of the American Impressionists working in the French countryside known as the Giverny Group.", "The sharp lines, geometric shapes and flat areas of color place Rooftops within the Precisionist             style.             Precisionism was influenced by industrial development, such as skyscrapers and factories, and shows images             painted with machine-like quality frozen in time like a photograph.", "The artist translated the activities of everyday life into a loosely knit tapestry of flat, bold             areas of color.             Prendergast preferred the medium of watercolor.             The site for this watercolor is probably a nature park near Salem, Massachusetts.", "With loose, fluid brushstrokes, the artist depicts the boats, cottages, and shore of this harbor,             while still emphasizing the flat surface of the canvas             Hawthorne studied under William Merritt Chase and helped run Chase\u2019s Long Island school before founding the             Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The town attracted many artists, and Hawthorne became             known as the \u201cfather\u201d of the art colony.             Paintings of Provincetown fishermen executed in a more somber palette so dominate the artist\u2019s work that             this lively, vibrant painting of Hyannisport, a town 50 miles away, represents an intriguing contrast.", "Mary Cassatt received her early training in America, but settled in Paris, where she exhibited             with the Impressionists in the late 1870s.             Children and motherhood provided the primary themes for Cassatt's work. She successfully avoided             sentimentalized views of childhood, focusing instead on her subjects freshness, intelligence and energy.             Like her mentor Edgar Degas, Cassatt worked well in pastel, a medium that utilized her drawing skills and             refined sense of texture.", "Marsh employed a graphic, linear technique to bring individuality to the travelers.             The newspaper headline refers to the sentencing of the convicted kidnapper of Charles Lindbergh's baby.             Marsh's artistic inspiration derived from his study of European Old Master painters.", "This canvas, with its intricate linear construction, exhibits the artist's dramatic use of             brilliant color.             Pueblo people used parrots as a source of feathers to decorate ceremonial objects.             Indiana-born Higgins gained his fame as a Western artist painting in Taos, New Mexico.", "Three nameless guests and a desk clerk occupy the disquieting, airless space of Hotel Lobby.             The cheerlessness of the foyer is enhanced by the lack of rapport among the figures.             Hopper is renowned for paintings infused with loneliness and banality.", "In this portrait Eaton's brushstrokes appear loose, but the drawing of the sitter's facial             features remains firm and solid.             Eaton spent only a short time in Indianapolis, during which he studied under Jacob Cox.  He eventually             settled in New York.             The artist developed a reputation as a skillful painter of women's portraits.", "The dark tonalities and unadorned background are typical of nineteenth century portraiture.             The delicate lace neckline fastened with a cameo pin and the tiny drop earring soften the dark tonality of             this portrait.             The Sewells were residents of Covington, Indiana.", "The simple, direct manner, combined with firm brushwork and the careful attention to detail in the             sitter's beard, hair and glasses, is evidence of Hays' skill as a portrait painter.             Much of Hays' renown came from his having tutored William Merritt Chase, but his reputation rested on the             quality of his portraits and fruit still lifes.", "Leigh was known as the  Sagebrush Rembrandt  due to his use of traditional European techniques.              The dark tonalities in this work reflect his training at the Royal Academy in Munich.             The artist strongly disliked modern, abstract art.             Leigh focused on the culture and traditions of the Hopi and Navajo Indians.", "Recognized primarily for his Cubist-inspired sculpture, Archipenko also featured the disjunctive             planes and irregular contours of Cubism in his paintings, such as Promenade.             Archipenko worked in Europe until emigrating to the United States in 1923.", "Mary Cassatt received her early training in America but settled in Paris, where she befriended             Edgar Degas and exhibited with the Impressionists.             Young children were among Cassatt's favorite subjects, though she avoided sentimental portrayals in favor of             emphasizing her models' freshness, intelligence, and energy.             This pastel is one in a series of portraits of children who lived in the French village where Cassatt spent             her summers.", "The stately composition and solid forms give the subject a dignity not often associated with fish             markets. Hawthorne's green-toned palette evokes the sea and emphasizes by contrasting color the bloody             business at hand.             This man was a Portuguese resident of the Cape Cod village where Hawthorne spent most of his career.", "Instead of the smooth finish that lends French nudes their remote idealism, this figure is brushed             with ruddy reflections of the walls, giving her flesh a sensuous realism, and suggesting Paxton's attraction             to Impressionism.             A transitional work, this nude predates most of the elegant interior scenes for which Paxton and his Boston             School colleagues are best known.", "The subject's origins in nature are suggested through color and texture and the repetition and             layering of forms, which create a rhythm reminiscent of fluttering wings.             Indiana-born Stevens was originally a landscape painter who eventually produced works that expressed nature             in an abstract manner.", "The casual pose of the portrait allows Love's personality to emerge.             The setting may have been a studio in the newly formed Indiana School of Art, the state's first art school.             Bates and Love settled in Indianapolis after studying together in Paris."]}, {"index": 13, "name": "provenance", "values": ["Purchase from Perls Gallery, New York, on April 6, 1962, by Frank C.

When Henri was ten years old, his father, a             gambler and real estate promoter, shot someone in self defense.  The family feared for their safety, moved             to Atlantic City, New Jersey, changed their name and passed their two sons off as adopted children.  Robert             Henri chose a variation on his middle name as his surname and attended boarding school in New York City.  He             received his art training at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then attended the Academy Julian             in Paris.  After spending several years in Europe, Henri taught at the Chase School of Art and the New York             School of Art where he led a fight against Academic views.  In 1909, Henri established his own school and             organized \u201cThe Eight,\u201d a group of artists that rejected the restraints from the National Academy of Design.              The Eight favored a style that portrayed contemporary everyday life.  Five members of this group, including             Henri, became known as the Ashcan School because of their depictions of the seedy side of life.  Henri             favored portraits of ordinary people, while the remainder of the group focused primarily on everyday street             scenes.             This portrait of professional model Edna Smith is typical of Henri\u2019s ability to capture his subject\u2019s             spirit.  Around 1909, Henri adopted the color system of theorist Hardesty Maratta, which assigns a letter             and number to 144 harmonically related colors.  Painters could use the system of letters and number to             carefully plan the color relationships of their paintings.  The rich harmonies of this image based on red             and green show Henri\u2019s use of the Maratta system.", "Edmund Brucker was born in Cleveland, Ohio and trained at the Cleveland School of Art.  He was an             accomplished painter working in a realist style when he joined the faculty of the John Herron Art Institute             in Indianapolis, where he taught until his retirement. Though he was best known as a portrait painter,             Brucker also painted regional scenes in both oil and watercolor.  Many of his works combine views from             sketches and drawings he made of different sites during different times of the day.  His palette of rich             gray tones emphasizes design, composition and line. As a portraitist, Brucker painted Indiana governor             Matthew E. Welsh as well as family, friends. He painted several portraits of African Americans, other local             citizens and fellow artists.             Monday Morning is an example of the more modernist idiom Brucker experiments with during the 1940s.              Elements of cubism and a design as precise as an architect\u2019s are present in the painting\u2019s ruler straight             lines, angularity, and compressed space.  Like other American artists of the time, Brucker painted back             alleys and industrial landscapes, views which seem to capture the stress-filled American society of the             1930s and 1940s.  The bright green spot of vegetation in the center of Brucker\u2019s subdued colors and             geometric shapes stands out as a symbol of nature and regeneration amid the urban environment.  Brucker\u2019s             inspiration for Monday Morning was a sketch he made on a sunny day in the Little Italy section of Cleveland,             Ohio.  Monday Morning was exhibited widely, including, in 1947 at the annual national art competition             sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.", "John Sloan was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania and moved with his family to Philadelphia where he attended             Central High School.  He worked for a print dealer and as a newspaper illustrator. Sloan studied at the             Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts where he met Robert Henri, and moved to New York to become a part of             Henri\u2019s urban realist circle. Under Henri\u2019s leadership Sloan and seven other artists opposed the traditional             hold that that the National Academy of Design had exerted over art in America.  In 1908 the group, which             became known as The Eight held an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery in New York.  Sloan and four other members             of the group painted down-to-earth subject matter which earned them the epithet of Ashcan School, because             critics felt their art was offensive. The Ashcan School artists recorded the bustling activity of New York\u2019s             lower East Side with broad, vigorous strokes and a conscious avoidance of sentimentality. Sloan taught at             the Art Student\u2019s League passing on his style of urban subject matter to Reginald Marsh and Raphael Soyer,             who followed in their teacher\u2019s footsteps.             Red Kimono on the Roof, an unglorified glimpse of a woman, clothespin in mouth, attending to her laundry,             may have been painted from Sloan\u2019s studio window, which would explain the elevated vantage point.  The             picture\u2019s sense of immediacy and direct observation is enhanced by the spontaneous brushwork and Sloan\u2019s             attention to light and shadow.", "Arthur B. Davies was born in Utica, New York and exhibited his talent for painting when he was sixteen.  His             family moved to Chicago where he studied at the Art Institute.  He went to New York City and continued his             studies at the Art Students League, where he met Robert Henri and George Luks.  As with many of the artists             who would later make up the group known as The Eight, Davies began his career as an illustrator.  He             discovered his distinctive style of the female nude in a landscape setting around the turn of the             twentieth-century.  Symbolic and poetic, these figures were posed in a frieze-like manner against             mysteriously dark backgrounds and seemed to have their roots in mythology.  In 1908, Davies joined a group             of artists at an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery which established these artists as \u201cThe Eight.\u201d  Davies             became president of the Society of Independent Artists and helped organize the 1913 Armory Show, which             introduced the American public to European avant-garde trends.  While Cubism had a short and minor influence             on Davies, he continued to focus on the idyllic figures that were the hallmark of his style.             Many of Davies\u2019 paintings exude a dream-like quality of detachment from the everyday world. In Across the             Harbor the artist painted a group of female figures, posing their stylized forms in the frieze-like             composition he often favored.  The unusual color scheme and the abrupt change of scale presented by the             sailboat heighten the painting\u2019s vague sense of otherworldly mystery.", "Constance Coleman Richardson grew up in Irvington, Indiana, where her father was director of the Indiana             State Historical Commission.  After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was             anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education.  The             compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at             the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston             Richardson.  After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit             Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years.  After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar             Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the             Pennsylvania Academy.  During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted             landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects.  Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling             during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums.             Richardson recalled that the site of this painting was the front yard of her family\u2019s home at 4314 North             Central in Indianapolis. Yet Richardson\u2019s lush green neighborhood scene transcends any specific place to             become a symbol of traditional middle-class America during the 1930s. The yards are large and well tended,             and the house across the street, characteristic of the days before air conditioning, has a broad, striped             awning.  Girls in dresses play under the streetlight, a watchful mother include din its reassuring glow.              Richardson\u2019s vision of the scene reduces figures, trees, even shadows to simplified geometric forms.  The             result is a painting that breathes the essence of a summer evening.  Very little imagination is required to             hear the gentle nocturnal sounds of crickets and cicadas.", "J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young             Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a             year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John             Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He             returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy             with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting             at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up             a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the             Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that             traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.              Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of             Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region\u2019s artists.  In 1898,             Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901,             Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from             1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as             Brookville.                 Shown in New York in 1886, Wash Day, Bavaria is the first painting Adams sent to America for exhibition.  It             may be surprising the artist would have chosen this kind of simple scene from everyday life for his debut.              The the diagonal lines of the grass and clothesline draw the viewer to the woman hanging her laundry.              Although the forms are solidly rendered in the academic tradition, this sunlit canvas is brighter and richer             in tonality than the dark scenarios preferred by the Royal Academy.  Adams always favored Wash Day, Bavaria             and hung it in a place of prominence in his studio when he returned to Muncie.", "Ruth Pratt Bobbs was born into a moneyed family in Indianapolis, Indiana. When she was eight years old, her             mother took her to Saturday art school.  At sixteen, after the death of her parents, Bobbs went to Paris,             where she studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian.  She returned to New York and enrolled in the Art Students             League.  By the time she came back to Indianapolis to continue her training at the John Herron Art             Institute, Bobbs had studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri, Kenyon Cox and Frank Vincent DuMond.              She also worked with Charles Webster Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts.  At twenty-eight she married             William C. Bobbs, president of the Bobbs-Merrill publishing company, a man twenty-three years her senior.             After the death of her husband in 1926, Bobbs went back to Paris and opened a studio.  When she returned to             Indianapolis, Bobbs opened a studio and gallery where she painted portraits of local citizens,             entrepreneurs, and government leaders. Despite coming from a wealthy family and marrying into wealth, which             created a great deal of skepticism regarding her sincerity as an artist, Bobbs proved she was serious by             becoming a very successful portrait painter.             When this figure study hung in Bobb\u2019s Indianapolis living room, visitors often mistook it for a self             portrait from her youth.  Although the sitter\u2019s hat and cape did belong to the artist, the model was a young             woman named Jesseca Penn.  While a student in New York, Bobbs met the Scotswoman who had just come to this             country and was looking for work.  Bobbs painted her and then sent her to pose for Robert Henri who was             teaching at the Chase School in New York.  The \u201cread-haired model,\u201d as she was later known, became a             favorite of Henri and posed for many of his best pictures.  The Japanese screen, a stock motif employed by             Bobbs\u2019s teachers in Boston and New York, creates the bright tones that suffuse the picture.  Its vertical             and diagonal bamboo stalks echo the lines of the sitter, deftly integrating the figure with the background.", "William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then             briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase             was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city\u2019s Royal Academy.  In 1878, Chase             returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style.              He was a member of America\u2019s influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely             influential teacher.  Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in             Shinnecock, Long Island.  He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the             Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley,             Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Charles Sheeler.             In 1870 Chase moved to St. Louis, where his family had relocated after losing their shoe business in             Indianapolis.  He hoped to support himself by satisfying the Victorian taste for still-life paintings of             flowers and fruit.  This early example of Chase\u2019s still-life painting suggests his awareness of other             American artists.  The hummingbird motif probably derives from the work of Martin Johnson Heade, and the             bouquet recalls John LaFarge\u2019s floral arrangements.  Chase considered flowers \u201cthe most difficult\u201d things to             paint, which may account for their scarcity in his work. Yet in 1872 his success in still-life painting             induced a group of local patrons to allow Chase to resume this education by sponsoring his attendance at the             Royal Academy in Munich.", "Jacob Hegler arrived in the Midwest around 1845 after emigrating from Switzerland.  He undoubtedly studied             drawing and painting before coming to America but did not turn to painting as a full-time vocation until             settling in Indiana.  He enjoyed great success as a portrait painting in the Wabash River town of Attica,             Indiana in the mid 1850s.             While in Attica, Hegler received a commission from Dr. Lewis Lyons to paint his daughter Alice.  He posed             the little girl and her dog against a background of country road and woodland. Dr. Lyons was a physician and             one of the town's prominent citizens. Every detail of the velvet-braided Victorian frock, the careful             smoothed curls and lace-ruffled pantalets is depicted in the precise, quaint fashion of the day. Her serious             expression reflects the mid-nineteenth century concept of children as small adults.  The rugged landscape             setting is a reminder of the frontier conditions that existed in parts of Indiana during the 1850s. Roger G.             Wolcott of Indianapolis purchased this canvas from the owner of the old Lyons home, and donated it to the             IMA.", "David Rubins was born in Minneapolis and received his education at Dartmouth College.  He then traveled to             Europe to continue his studies at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and Acad\u00e9mie Julian.  Rubins was also a fellow in             sculpture at the American Academy in Rome.  His sculpture was primarily figurative and included a monument             of Abraham Lincoln as a young man for the Indiana State Capitol and the bronze cherub that was on the clock             during Christmas season at L. S. Ayres and Company in downtown Indianapolis. Rubins is also known for his             busts of prominent people, including the architect Evans Woolen, President William Henry Harrison and             Indianapolis Governor Henry Schricker.  Rubins taught sculpture and anatomy at the Herron School of Art in             Indianapolis.             In his figural sculpture, Rubins usually sought harmonious proportions and a pensive quality, preferring             rounded, ideal forms to the angular or distorted.  The balance and feminine grace of this bronze figure             recall early twentieth-century French sculpture by artists such as Aristide Mailllol.", "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             The Bloom of the Grape, painted in Vernon, Indiana, in early November 1893 during what Steele called \u201ca             glorious autumn,\u201d is the artist\u2019s best-known landscape.  Its title refers to the white gauzy veil, known as             \u201cbloom,\u201d covering grapes at harvest time.  Steele wrote to his wife that he had never seen better color,             \u201csuch dull reads and crimsons and faded yellows and oranges, in juxtaposition with such royal purples.\u201d             These rich color harmonies are captured in this painting in a manner that critic Charles F. Browne described             as conservatively impressionistic, but not wild.  The luminosity and color harmonies found in Bloom of the             Grape exemplify the new approach to landscape painting that would earn Steele national recognition for his             modified Impressionist style.", "George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America             in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon             hearing of the plight of northern Indiana\u2019s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what             became known as \u201cPotawatomi Trail of Death,\u201d Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana to document their             culture.  After thirteen years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in             California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known             primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose             not only convey the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is             also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians             and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.              The IMA collection contains several paintings by George Winter two of which are titled Scene on the Wabash.              Both of these works portray a group of Potawatomi Indians gathered next to the Wabash River. The figures are             posed in a casual setting, reflecting Winter\u2019s goal of recording the daily life and customs of these people.             This particular painting concentrates on family activities, particularly women washing clothes in the             Wabash.  It exemplifies the type of gathering of the Potawatomi that established Winter\u2019s reputation as an             artist.", "Born in Nova Scotia, Ernest Lawson spent his youth in Ontario.  He joined his physician father in Kansas             City and began studying at the Kansas City Art Institute.  Lawson traveled to Mexico with his father working             as a draftsman and studying at the Santa Clara Art Academy and then went to New York to enroll at the Art             Students League.  Lawson spent time at the summer school of Cos Cob, Connecticut where he began painting out             of doors.  He travelled to France to continue his studies in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and shared a             studio with Somerset Maugham, who used Lawson as the prototype for Frederic Lawson in his novel, \u201cOf Human             Bondage.\u201d  After returning to New York, Lawson settled in Washington Heights, an area he painted numerous             times.  Lawson continued traveling, spending time in France, Spain and in New England painting in Cos Cob,             Connecticut and Cornish, New Hampshire.  He taught at The Art Institute in Kansas City and Broadmoor             Academy.  Lawson was one of the members of \u201cThe Eight\u201d who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in 1908. He was one             of the three artists in this group who is not considered an Ashcan School painter, because of his focus on             impressionist landscapes rather than the urban realist subjects that fascinated his fellow artists.               April may depict a stretch of the Harlem River near Lawson\u2019s home in Washington Heights, New York.  Lawson             had studied with American Impressionist John Twachtman and adopted his practice of building up paint in a             thick crust of interwoven cover. The pastel yellow-greens, blue-greens and pinks contrast with a few patches             of dark purple and blue and ably convey the look of a cool, soggy day in early spring.", "Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his father\u2019s business failed, the family came to             Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi and             the Acad\u00e9mie Julian.  Prendergast became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who             included Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William             Glackens.  Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat             areas of boldly contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have             been described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight,             Prendergast favored people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Prendergast             earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors and oils depicting bustling crowds.  He             is remembered today as one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of C\u00e9zanne and turn them into his             personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  Prendergast\u2019s brother Charles was an important frame maker             whose frames can often be seen on his brother\u2019s work.             In Glimpse of the Harbor, Gloucester, Prendergast handles this watercolor view of the Massachusetts harbor             with typical freedom, wielding thin washes in loosely knit strokes and allowing broad areas of the white             paper to figure in the composition. Patterns contrast between rigid geometry and curvilinear forms.  The             people are characteristically blended into the scene so they do not disturb the rhythm of the composition.", "George Luks was born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania and received his first art instruction from his parents             who painted as a hobby.  His formal education began at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then in             D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.  He also traveled to London and Paris returning to the United States to work as an             artist for Philadelphia newspapers.  He roomed with fellow illustrator Everett Shinn and became acquainted             with George Luks, William Glackens, John Sloan and later Robert Henri who, along with Shinn, became known as             the Philadelphia Five.  Luks also drew comic strips, but gave up illustration to become a full time artist.              His career as an illustrator drew his interests to painting urban street scenes. Luks had a vibrant,             sometime raucous, personality that is expressed in his lively portraits and urban subjects.  He joined             Robert Henri\u2019s circle in their depictions of city life and became part of the Ashcan School.   He was also a             member of the rebellious group known as \u201cThe Eight\u201d who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in New York in 1908.              Because Luks was a heavy drinker, he became involved in a barroom brawl that ended in his death.             New Year\u2019s Shooter dates from around the first exhibition of The Eight, who had banded together to oppose             the rigid formulas of academic painting.  He shared with Robert Henri an energetic brushwork, patterned             after the dynamic seventeenth-century Dutch painter Frans Hals.  Luks sympathized with the powerless \u2013             immigrants, the poor, children \u2013 and was at his best when portraying them.  The colorful palette of New             Year\u2019s Shooter is in tune with the gaiety and theatricality of the subject.", "George Bellows was born in Columbus, Ohio and attended Ohio State University where he provided illustrations             for the school\u2019s student yearbook.  Before graduating, he left Ohio State to study art in New York City             where he became a student of Robert Henri at the New York School of Art.  Bellows became associated with             Henri\u2019s group which was known as \u201cThe Eight\u201d and the Ashcan School. He taught at the Art Student League of             New York, while painting urban New York scenes depicting working-class people.  His most important work was             his series of paintings portraying amateur boxing matches.             Bellows\u2019s fame grew and he began to receive portrait commissions from wealthy New Yorkers.  In addition to             painting, Bellows made important contributions to lithography and created more than 100 images. During his             later career, he illustrated a number of books, including several by H. G. Wells.              Portrait of a Boy depicts Meredith Hare, the young son of a wealthy family living in Tuxedo Park, New York.              In a letter to his wife, Bellows wrote that Mrs. Hare had asked for a picture of her son in a stiff white             collar and formal pose.  Bellows fulfilled her request but then executed this portrait, which reveals the             details of loose, soft clothing, tousled hair and inquisitive expression, the sitter\u2019s charmingly boyish             character.  Unable to decide which portrait she preferred, Mrs. Hare took neither.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in             separate ferry accidents.  Cox\u2019s grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians.  By             that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of             sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in             Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835             painting portraits was added to Cox\u2019s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with             John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith,             Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen             and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National             Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When             the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He             continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.              Brook in Summer reflects Cox\u2019s high regard for traditional, pastoral landscapes filled with lush scenery and             soft light.  Cox varies the format of the traditional landscape by placing the trees, bushes and fallen             branches randomly, as they appear in nature, rather than in an idealized order.  This setting is probably a             composite of sketches of the Indianapolis countryside and views invented by Cox.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in             separate ferry accidents.

Brewer hung in his son Charles\u2019s home for fifty-five years before it was             offered as a gift to the IMA.  The family recounts that the elder Brewer was about twelve years old when Cox             painted him.  According to Brewer\u2019s son, the artist finished the painting in his studio, added the fishing             rod and dog, which did not belong to the sitter.  Such attributes, including the imaginary landscape in the             background, were common practices in nineteenth century portraiture and served to enhance the sitter\u2019s             status or, in this case, add to the image of a childhood.", "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve.

He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             Pleasant Run has been called the masterpiece of Steele\u2019s Munich manner.  It was painted within months of the             artist\u2019s return from five years of study in Germany, where he became increasingly devoted to painting from             nature.  The canvas\u2019s dark tonalities, backlighting, and even its composition, relate to Steele\u2019s scenes of             Bavaria.  Yet as the artist noted in his journal, he remained sensitive to the nuances of the Indiana             landscape, carefully recording its color contrasts and clear light.  In 1885 when T. C. Steele painted this             landscape, Pleasant Run defined the eastern and southern limits of Indianapolis.  The area depicted here was             located just north of Irvington at the southwest corner of what is now Arlington and Tenth Street.", "William Forsyth was born in California, Ohio, not far from Cincinnati. His early use of the family\u2019s walls             as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity.              When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis.  Forsyth started his art             studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen.  He earned his living painting houses with his brother and             used his free time to explore his artistic talents.  Forsyth became on of the first student in the newly             established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school.  His desire for             more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the             Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these             trips home to sell at exhibitions.  When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two             years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.  After the school closed,             Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933.              Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took             commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the             Depression.  In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.             In 1883 William Forsyth entered the Technical Painting Class of Ludwig von L\u00f6fftz, where he received a full             grounding the painting of portrait heads and figure studies.  In this canvas painted about midway through             his six-year stay in Europe, Forsyth focuses on the time-worn quality of the woman\u2019s hands and facial             features.  Old Market Woman exemplifies the Munich School\u2019s dark tonality and bravura brushwork, derived             from the 17th-century Dutch portraits of Rembrandt and Hals.", "Determined to be an artist, Scudder left Terre Haute, Indiana in her teens to study at the Academy of Art in             Cincinnati.  By age 20 she was one of Lorado Taft\u2019s \u201cwhite rabbits,\u201d the female assistants who aided him in             his many sculpture projects for the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  In 1894 she sought             training in France, where she eventually established her home and studio.  Active beyond her work as a             sculptor, Scudder participated in the women\u2019s suffrage movement in the United States, wrote an autobiography             entitled Modelling My Life, and was honored by France as a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur.  Scudder came             back to the United States nearly every year to seek fountain projects from landscape architects. During the             early 20th century a wide-spread American demand for garden sculpture provided Scudder with many             commissions, earning her the title \u201cWoman of the Fountains.\u201d             As a young artist in France, Scudder persuaded the successful American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies to             break his rule against taking students. Scudder incorporated MacMonnies lively naturalistic modeling into             Frog Fountain. She said that this bronze was inspired by children she observed in Italy, a country renowned             for its fountain sculpture.  The chubby little boy, his hair garlanded with flowers, dances between three             nervous frogs.

He continued his training at the Pennsylvania             Academy of the Fine Arts and the Art Students League in New York.  After completing his study at the             Pennsylvania Academy, Stark was awarded the Cresson scholarship to study and travel in Europe.  He became             head of the sculpture department and instructor in oil still life painting at the John Herron Art             Institute.  Stark produced work in sculpture, pastels, watercolors and oils.             This portrait bust was completed in the last year of Forysth\u2019s life.  No longer \u201ccocky,\u201d as he often was             accused of being, Forsyth was old, sad and disillusioned over the loss of his position as teacher at             Herron.  Stark succeeded in vividly capturing his sitter\u2019s emotional state by rendering the artist before             him in a truthful manner.", "William Forsyth was born in California, Ohio, not far from Cincinnati.

The scene may             depict the landing at Madison, Indiana.  Relying on his extensive outdoor painting experience, Forsyth             created the intense, humid light of a landscape painted directly from nature.  His animated brushwork belies             the fact that he was physically weakened by his heart attack.", "Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early             employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that             combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that             time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in             Franklin, Indiana.  He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper             illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among             his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to             attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local             models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich\u2019s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana             patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States,             where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of             forty-three.             The course of study in the Technical Painting Class at the Royal Academy in Munich consisted of rigorous             instruction in the painting of heads, followed by full figure work.  This procedure continued the teaching             methods begun in the drawing classes, where the major portion of the day was spent rendering portrait             studies of elderly peasant types.  Using the masters of Dutch 17th-century portraiture, Rembrandt and Hals,             as prototypes, L\u00f6fftz had his students restrict the basic harmony of their paintings to soft, shadowy grays,             relieved only by sharp details in the highlights.

Emphasizing the dark tonalities of             the Old Dutch Masters, he demanded that his students restrict their palettes to carefully modulated browns,             ochres, grays, and off-whites with the intention of reigning in impulses toward harsh local colors.  His             policy of reducing color to a narrow range of harmonies drove the more impulsive students to distraction.               A Swiss artist complained: \u201cIn my study of that woman I was well on my way to losing the color altogether as             I continually tried to subdue the tone toward gray.\u201d  Such struggles are evident in Richards\u2019s portraits             with their emphasis on dark tonalities devoid of high key color.", "Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early             employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.

The carefully delineated facial features of this model are in stark contrast to the loose, animated strokes             that define his hair and clothes. Richard\u2019s free handling of the paint makes it difficult to differentiate             between the man\u2019s attire and his long flowing beard.  While the model\u2019s face exemplifies the perfect outline             found in the work of German Renaissance artist Albrecht D\u0171rer, the rest of the canvas exhibits the influence             of the bravura brushwork associated with the 17th-century Dutch painter Franz Hals.  These seemingly             opposing influences combined to form the dominant style of the Royal Academy know as Munich realism.", "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.

In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             The young woman in Steele\u2019s canvas represents a departure from the Royal Academy\u2019s preference for older             models.  This attractive figure, whose youthful facial features emerge from the dark shadows, is rendered in             brown tonalities against an unadorned, dark background.  The setting and execution exemplify the austere             style espoused by Germany\u2019s Royal Academy teachers.  L\u00f6fftz was prone to severe criticism of the \u201csweet             color\u201d in his students\u2019 work and praised such somber and meditative images as Munich Girl.", "George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America             in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon             hearing of the plight of northern Indiana\u2019s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what             became known as \u201cPotawatomi Trail of Death,\u201d Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their             culture.  After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in             California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known             primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose             not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is             also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians             and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.              Winter\u2019s arrival in Logansport, Indiana, coincided with the last months of the Potawatomi in Indiana.  His             ambition to record, with an ethnographer\u2019s attention to detail, the daily life and customs of the Wabash             Potawatomi resulted in scores of drawings, made between 1837 and 1838, which served as the basis for Indian             paintings such as Scene on the Wabash. The Potawatomi\u2019s contented expressions are at odds with the overall             melancholy of the barren landscape.  Winter often included a dead tree in his Potawatomi pictures as a             symbol of their removal from native lands.", "Ketcham took an early interest in art and helped establish two art schools in Indianapolis, but she did not             begin to paint seriously until she was over forty years old.  Born to a pioneering Indiana family, Ketcham             became a painter and teacher.  She was one of eighteen women who in 1883 founded the Art Association of             Indianapolis which became the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Herron School of Art and Design.  She             organized the artwork for the Art Association\u2019s first exhibition and hired faculty to open the school.  For             the first year, she taught at the school and took summer trips in the U. S. and Europe.  As a middle-aged             woman, Ketcham enrolled in the Art Students League in New York and was elected a life member.  She studied             with William Merritt Chase and became godmother to his son.  New York was the focus of her life, and she             became involved with the Art Students League.  In the summers, she went to Ogunquit, Maine to paint             seascapes and teach summer classes.             Ketcham probably painted this young woman during her first year of study with William Merritt Chase in New             York.  Its dark, warm tones and freely brushed manner betray the Munich School\u2019s influence, which she             absorbed through Chase.  The painting\u2019s title suggests the importance the artist placed upon the sweeping             dark oval form of the woman\u2019s large hat. Its shape and color contrast with the delicate neckline of the             lace-edged blouse.", "J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young             Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a             year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John             Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He             returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy             with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting             at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up             a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the             Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that             traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.              Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of             Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region\u2019s artists.  In 1898,             Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901,             Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from             1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as             Brookville.                 Brookville, just a few miles southwest of Indianapolis, was far removed from the bustle of the city.              Although only a small town in Morgan County, it was easily accessible by railroad.  Local historians do not             remember the exact location of Thornberry\u2019s pasture.  In this picturesque view of an autumn afternoon, Adams             achieves the impressionist goal of capturing the light and atmosphere of a specific moment.  The setting sun             leaves the foreground landscape in deep shadow, the grassy terrain dappled with sunlight, and the middle             ground fully engulfed in a flowing autumnal light.  Adams uses a vertical canvas to place a strong emphasis             on the trees that blanket the blue sky with their orange foliage.", "Robert Weaver was born in Peru, Indiana and attended the Herron School of art in Indianapolis where he             received a Bachelor of Fine Art degree in painting.  He studied Fresco painting techniques at the Skowhegan             School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. Weaver traveled to Mexico and Europe.  He maintained a studio in             New York\u2019s Greenwich Village for two years.  He was the young painter to be awarded the Julius Halgarten for             a circus painting shown at the Annual National Academy of design exhibition in New York City.  He also             exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, The Corcoran Biennial, the Carnegie International             and the San Francisco World\u2019s Fair.  After returning to Indiana, Weaver served as foreman in a machine             company until he received a commission in the U. S. Navy.  He retired from the Navy with the rank of             Lieutenant and a year later joined the faculty of the Herron School of Art where he taught painting, mural             design, drawing and illustration. Weaver was president of the Circus City Festival, Inc. and piloted a             beautification program known as \u201cOperation Facelift\u201d in Peru, Indiana for which he was voted \u201cMan of the             Year.\u201d             Weaver\u2019s Peru birthplace was the winter home to most of America\u2019s great circuses.  He spent his free time             around circus people and took a job as a ticket taker at a sideshow, so he could become a part of the world             he had grown to love.  His favorite painting subject was circus life.  In Circus Poster, a large brick home             sits in the distance snow-covered landscape, while a dilapidated wood building is set in the foreground.              The bare trees and darkened sky give the scene an eerie quality.  The circular roadway surrounding the             building draws attention to it and its torn circus poster.  The yellow arrow road sign seems to suggest the             circus is to the viewer\u2019s right.", "William Henry Hilliard was born in Auburn, New York.  He moved to Madison, Indiana and ten years later to             Indianapolis. Before arriving in Indiana, Hilliard was a sailor, a landscape painter in the West, and an art             student in Chicago, where he lost all of his work in the Great fire of 1871. Hilliard left Indiana after             1876 and studied and worked in Europe, primarily England, Scotland and France. Hilliard was known for his             New England landscapes and coastal scenes, which resemble the Hudson River School in their romantic realism.             Sometime after returning to New York from Europe Hilliard added floral subjects to his landscape work.             Hilliard ultimately settled in Washington, D. C.                This small painting of roses is among the most sophisticated works produced in Indiana during the early             1870s.  It displays Hilliard\u2019s fluid brushwork and his subtle control of the contrast of light and dark             tonalities.  The slightly unbalanced, casual arrangement of the flowers suggests Hilliard was aware of             Japanese design.  Japanese art played a significant role in late nineteenth-century European and American             painting.", "George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America             in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon             hearing of the plight of northern Indiana\u2019s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what             became known as \u201cPotawatomi Trail of Death,\u201d Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their             culture.  After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in             California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known             primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose             not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is             also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians             and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.              Winter\u2019s early training in England exposed him to the traditional pastoral, classically inspired landscapes             modeled after the work of 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain.  Although this canvas purportedly             depicts a view of the Wabash River near Lafayette, the graceful trees that frame the foreground, the             measured recession of space, and the warm, dusky light suggest that it is a thoroughly idealized scene.             Landscapes that partially transformed the untamed Indiana countryside into an orderly, ideal world probably             appealed to Winter\u2019s purchasers.", "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             Situated between the German towns of Dachau and Schleissheim, the Dachau Moor was a favorite painting spot             for Steele and Forsyth.  It offered a serene landscape where the Hoosier artists could spend undisturbed             hours sketching and painting.  Here in the dwindling late afternoon light, Steele captures the essence of             the quiet scene.  In this richly r=textured landscape, the thick areas of white suggest reflections from the             sun\u2019s descending rays on the rippling water. The sense of solitude is broken only by the two peasant women             fathering reeds in the dimly lit landscape.  Painted near the end of his stay in Munich, the dark,             gray-green tonality of Late Afternoon is a legacy of Steele\u2019s academic training.", "Donald Mattison was born in Beloit, Wisconsin.  He attended Yale University where he received a bachelor of             fine arts degree.  Mattison moved to Chicago to work as an assistant for the muralist Eugene Savage.             Although he produced notable murals and paintings of figures and landscapes, Mattison turned to portraiture             later in his career.  He won the Prix de Rome in 1928, a scholarship for art students that provided the             opportunity to study abroad.  Mattison spent the next three years in Europe, where he was a fellow at the             American Academy in Rome.  After his fellowship ended, Mattison moved back to America where he taught at New             York University, Columbia University and the New York School of Design.  In 1933, he was offered a permanent             full-time position as the Dean of John Herron Art School in Indianapolis, where he also continued to teach.              Mattison\u2019s art is rooted in the classical tradition.  He worked primarily in oil to capture the pleasant             aspects of life, including landscapes, community celebrations, and children at play.   His 150 portraits             included, U. S. Supreme Court Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sherman Minton, Indiana Governors Paul McNutt             and Harold W. Handley, author Booth Tarkington, and the former president of the New York Stock Exchange Emil             Schram.              Carnival, which should have been a lighthearted subject, is enveloped in an eerie darkness that hangs over             the amusement park like an ominous cloud.  The man wearing a white, costume-like robe and playing a violin             is more reminiscent of a beggar than a clown.  The viewer cannot see the faces of the two women walking             toward the stairs and the people at the bottom of the steps are barely visible in the dim light.  Mattison             may have intended to paint a happy event, but the uncertainties of the Depression have clearly found their             way onto his canvas.", "Otto Stark was born in Indianapolis and apprenticed at the age of twelve to lithography.  At age sixteen, he             studied at the Art Academy of Cincinnati and then entered the Art Students League of New York.  He later             went to Paris where he continued his studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and became a member of the Soci\u00e9te des             Beaux Arts et Belles Lettres.  He exhibited twice at the Paris Salon, the International Exhibition of Art             and History in Rome and the Panama Pacific Exhibition, where he was in charge of the Indiana Exhibition.              For twenty years, Stark was the head of the Art Department of Emmerich Manual Training High School and an             instructor in composition at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis. He was one of the five members             of the Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, J. Ottis Adams, T. C.             Steele, William Forsyth and Richard Gruelle.             Stark took up residence in New York City, after completing his training in Paris.  When his wife died, he             came back to his native Indiana.  A Summer Morning was painted while Stark was visiting the Hermitage, J.             Ottis Adams\u2019 Brookville home.  It portrays the artist\u2019s eldest daughter Gretchen, seated in shade with her             back to sunlit lawn, engrossed in her needlework. This solidly painted figure, posed against a loosely             constructed landscape, exemplifies the American Impressionist style.", "J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young             Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a             year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John             Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He             returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy             with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting             at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up             a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the             Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that             traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.              Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of             Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region\u2019s artists.  In 1898,             Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901,             Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from             1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as             Brookville.                 This study of a half-draped man was probably painted during the two years Adams spent in Professor L\u00f6fftz\u2019s             Technical Painting Class.  The unidealized figure sits in a dramatically lit interior, animated by contrasts             of light and dark.  A thread of light describes the contour of the model and catches in its aura the             smallest nuances of hair on the head, chin, chest, arms, and back.  These effects can result only from the             closest and most time consuming study.  Such labor was expected of the students in L\u00f6fftz\u2019s painting class.", "Constance Coleman Richardson grew up in Irvington, Indiana, where her father was director of the Indiana             State Historical Commission.  After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was             anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education.  The             compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at             the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston             Richardson.  After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit             Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years.  After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar             Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the             Pennsylvania Academy.  During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted             landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects.  Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling             during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums.             Richardson\u2019s love of the landscape is apparent in Hot Sun.  Here strong contrasts of bright sunlight             intermingle with dark shadows, and lush green foliage. The dominant tree   is stippled with light that peaks             through its dark leaves. Rocks and tree stumps add a rustic element to this serene landscape, while the             houses in the distance and the young boy seated on the stone wall add a human touch.  Everything in this             composition suggests a peaceful coexistence between people and nature.", "Thomas Glessing was born in London, but settled in America when he was twenty years old.  He was best known             for his theatrical scenery and landscapes.  Glessing also decorated the interior of Old Fellows Hall in             Indianapolis and was commissioned to paint a series of large canvases that illustrate the city\u2019s history for             the first Indiana exposition in 1873.  Glessing left Indianapolis in 1873 to accept a position as scenic             painter at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.             In 1859, at the time Glessing painted Landscape with Figures, he was in Indianapolis decorating the             Metropolitan Theatre.  Glessing\u2019s landscape shows the influence of Indiana artist Jacob Cox as well as             knowledge of his English heritage.  His inclusion of figures turns this romantic landscape into a genre             scene that is reminiscent of the Holy Family, complete with manger, mother and child, Joseph and John.", "Wayman Adams was born on a farm near Muncie Indiana to a Quaker father who was a livestock breeder and             amateur artist. Adams\u2019 father encouraged his interest in art.  The first portrait commission the young boy             received was a picture of a heifer named \u201cGypsy Girl III\u201d for which he was paid five dollars.  In 1904 Adams             began his art education at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he spent four years studying             under William Forsyth.  In 1910 Adams traveled with William Merritt Chase and his students to study art in             Italy.  A few years later he made a similar trip to Spain with Robert Henri.  Adams\u2019 developed a style of             \u201calla-prima\u201d painting, which means \u201call at once,\u201d is a method of painting in which the work is completed in             one sitting, usually without the use of glazing or underpainting.  These rapidly painted works contain             energetic brushwork and bold, expressive images.  Adams was an extremely prolific painter whose subjects             included U. S. presidents, university leaders, authors, artists, society ladies, actors and actresses,             military heroes, sports personalities, musicians, royalty, and governors.  \u201cAt one point in his career,             Adams had studios in Indianapolis New York City and Philadelphia.  During the winter he traveled             extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects.              In terms of awards and honors, Adams may be Herron\u2019s most successful alumnus, winning prizes in most of the             major national competitions during his 60-year career.  This portrait of the conductor of the Indianapolis             Orchestra, Alexander Ernestinoff, won the Proctor Prize at the National Academy of Design in 1914 and             vaulted Adams into the ranks of the country\u2019s leading portraitists.  The flowing brushwork reveals the             influence of Adams\u2019 principal teacher at Herron, William Forsyth, as well as his instruction in New York             with the American masters of bravura painting, Robert Henri and William Merritt Chase.  In keeping with             Chase and Henri\u2019s method of rapid execution, Adams is reported to have completed the Ernestinoff likeness in             just three hours.  According to Adams\u2019 account of the sitting, Ernestinoff came into the studio and casually             dropped into a chair, still wearing his hat and overcoat.  The relaxed pose so appealed to Adams\u2019 love of             the spontaneous that it became the basis for the portrait.", "William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then             briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase             was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city\u2019s Royal Academy.  In 1878, Chase             returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style.              He was a member of America\u2019s influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely             influential teacher.  Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in             Shinnecock, Long Island.  He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the             Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley,             Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Charles Sheeler.             When Chase painted this portrait of his grandfather, he was no more than eighteen years old and Moses Swaim             just over seventy.  Young Chase had only recently begun studying with Indianapolis artist Barton Hays, but             his likeness convincingly portrays the rugged features and earnest expression of this agricultural pioneer.              The tightly brushed portrait is one of Chase\u2019s earliest canvases. It descended in the artist\u2019s family,             surviving a house fire and a long period in a Kansas drug store.  When it entered the IMA, the image was             marred by soot, small holes and an improperly fitted frame.  After treatment in the museum\u2019s laboratory and             careful reframing, Chase\u2019s grandfather now reveals the startlingly early prowess of his portraiture.", "Henrik Mayer was born in Nashua, New Hampshire and took his art training at the Manchester Institute of Arts             and the Yale School of Fine Art.  He studied in Europe as a Winchester Fellow before accepting a teaching             position in New York City where he also served as designer and decorator of the New York Cosmopolitan Club.              In 1934, Mayer moved to Indianapolis where he became assistant director under Donald Mattison at the Herron             Art School.   During this period, Mayer exhibited his paintings at the Hoosier Salon, Herron Art Institute,             Art Institute of Chicago, Corcoran Gallery Biennial, and the National Academy of Design where he won a             prize.  He also accepted mural commissions at such places as the post office building in Lafayette,             Indiana.  In 1946, Mayer moved to Essex, Connecticut, where he became director of the Hartford Art School of             the Wadsworth Athenaeum. He later became dean of the Art School of the University of Harford in Connecticut             and also served as director of the Wadsworth Athenaeum.              The depression-era mural projects of the Works Progress Administration probably influenced Mayer\u2019s choice of             grand-scale designs, and although he may never have intended Halloween Carnival to become a mural, it looks             as if it could be a section of an enormous panorama of Halloween revelers.  According to the artist\u2019s wife,             Mayer\u2019s painting was inspired by Halloween celebrations that were once held on Monument Circle in downtown             Indianapolis.", "Grant Christian was born in Edinburgh, Indiana and attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis             and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.  While in art school, Christian entered             numerous art competitions which were offered through the government\u2019s New Deal program and was selected as a             mural artist for the old Indianapolis post office and the Nappanee, Indiana post office.  Christian spent             most of his career as a commercial illustrator and held art directorships and executive positions in several             advertising firms.              In 1936, Christian was the recipient of the Hoosier Salon\u2019s Thomas Meek Butler Prize for his landscape, The             Edge of Town.  The painting was highly praised in the local newspaper as an example of how a railroad track             and an unsightly dump can be transformed into a \u201cthing of beauty by means of sunlight and radiant atmosphere             \u2013 and by an artist\u2019s poetic touch.\u201d", "Wayman Adams was born on a farm near Muncie Indiana to a Quaker father who was a livestock breeder and             amateur artist.

During the winter he traveled             extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects.              The Art Jury, which depicts T C. Steele, Otto, Stark, J. Ottis Adams, and William Forsyth, the Hoosier Group             artists who were Adams\u2019 first teachers in Indiana, exemplifies the Adams\u2019 group portraits.  This realistic             view of his mentors shows them judging works of art.  Each portrait is carefully constructed to express the             artists\u2019 personalities, demeanor and facial features.  The portrait even shows Forsyth smoking, Stark with a             cane and the signature beards worn by the men.  It is one of the few group images of the members of the             Hoosier Group that depicts their likenesses with such accuracy. The only missing member, Richard Gruelle,             died before the work was painted.             The Indianapolis Museum of Art has more than fifty works by Wayman Adams in its American collection.  Many             of these are portraits of famous Indiana residents. Included in this group are the author Booth Tarkington,             the poet James Whitcomb Riley, the pharmaceutical giant, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., the artist Randolph Coats and             the local art dealer Carl Herman Lieber.", "Clifton Wheeler was born in Hadley, Indiana, but his family moved to Mooresville when he was a child.  Later             Wheeler met William Forsyth who gave him encouragement and technical guides.  Wheeler went to New York City             and studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri and Kenneth Hayes Miller.  His fellow classmates             included Ge3orge Bellows Edward Hopper and guy P\u00e8ne DuBois.  He traveled to Italy with Chase\u2019s painting             class and later to Paris and became friends with Gertrude Stein and Pablo Picasso.  Although he was urged to             stay in New York, Wheeler returned home to Indiana where he taught for many years at the Herrron Art             Institute and Butler University.  In the summer he taught at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  He             painted in North Carolina, Michigan, Tennessee and Upstate New York capturing scenes of the Black, Smoky,             Rocky and Catskill Mountains as well as the dunes on Lake Michigan.  Wheeler painted in an impressionist             style with a strong sense of color and design.             Wheeler probably painted In the Catskills near the artists\u2019 colony at Woodstock, New York.  The staccato             pattern of blocky brushstrokes, reminiscent of Forsyth\u2019s landscape technique, enhances the sense of nature             in movement.  Wheeler\u2019s design, based on a grid, reinforces the serenity of the woodland view.", "John Washington Love arrived in Indianapolis with his parents when he was ten years old.  After studying in             the public schools and Northwestern Christian University, Love decided to become an artist.  He entered the             studio of Barton Hays and later went to Cincinnati to continue his studies.  After a year he went to New             York and entered the School of the National Academy of Design.  He then traveled to Paris and was the first             Indiana artist to enter the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the At\u00e9lier G\u00e9r\u00f4me where he studied for four years.              After six years of European study, Love return to Indianapolis and set up the first Indiana School of Art             with fellow artist James F. Gookins. Love\u2019s promising career was cut short with his death at the age of             thirty.             After Love returned from study in France, his interest in landscape painting continued.  The influence of             the French Barbizon painters is apparent in the dark tones and the loose, broken brushstrokes that sweep             across the canvas.  In this Indianapolis landscape scene, the tradition of the Barbizon painters is mingled             with Love\u2019s own individual style", "Jacob Dunn, a native of Indiana and the son of a state treasurer, decided to enter the Indianapolis studio             of Jacob Cox in 1840.  After a short period of art training, he took up medicine and received a degree from             a college in Cincinnati.  Other than his appointment as an assistant surgeon in the Mexican Ware, it is not             known to what extent Dunn practiced medicine.  He was listed among the painters of Indianapolis in the             spring of 1851.  During the first few months Jacob Cox was in Cincinnati he and Dunn had a studio together.              Dunn, whose early death Jacob Cox attributed to excessive drinking, ironically chose the Temperance Pledge             as the subject for this painting.  It represents a man who hesitates before signing the pledge, while his             wife encourages him and the devil offers him a glass of liquor.  The man\u2019s mended coat and frayed collar and             shirt make his poverty painfully obvious, while the redness of his face suggests that what little money he             did have was being spent on liquor.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in             separate ferry accidents.  Cox\u2019s grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians.  By             that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of             sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in             Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835             painting portraits was added to Cox\u2019s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with             John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith,             Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen             and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National             Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When             the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He             continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.              Cox often modeled his landscapes after the calm, pastoral views of Hudson River school painters, such as             Asher B. Durand. Landscape near Indianapolis may depict a stretch of Fall Creek north of the city, an area             Cox frequently painted.  The three figures in the lower left could be a family about to begin the arduous             transformation from the frontier into the orderly Indiana farmland pictured in the distance.  The bridge in             the composition\u2019s center reinforces the idea of transition from wilderness to productive land.  Cox\u2019s soft             brushwork and saturated pastel palette convey a sense of optimism about life in Indiana in the 1860s.", "Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early             employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that             combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that             time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in             Franklin, Indiana.  He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper             illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among             his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to             attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local             models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich\u2019s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana             patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States,             where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of             forty-three.             Richards completed his training at the Royal Academy in 1887, but unlike the other Hoosier artists, he             showed no interest in landscape painting or any inclination to return to Indiana in the near future.              Instead, he entered the mainstream of professional figure painting in Munich.  This portrait, presumed to be             the artist\u2019s Munich-born daughter Gretchen, epitomizes all the richness of detail and formality associated             with Munich realism.  Gretchen is posed in profile against an unadorned background.  Her hair and facial             features are executed with exquisite detail.  Richards\u2019 use of dark tonalities is in keeping with his Munich             training, but the delicate pink scarf relieves the starkness of the composition.", "Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.  Hays drew on             barn walls with charcoal and saw his first oil painting at age twenty.  He moved to northern Indiana, where             after painting portraits of family and friends, he began accepting portrait commissions to earn a living.              In 1858, Hays moved to Indianapolis, where he became a partner in a photography firm.  He tinted             photographs and painted over enlarged prints.  Hays was one of the first art teachers in Indianapolis. Among             his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.  Much of his renown came from his ability             to convince Chase\u2019s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.  Hays was successful             in receiving the commission to paint governor William Harrison\u2019s portrait.  He was one of the original             members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.             Hay\u2019s likeness of Dr. Lyons is typical of early American portraits.  The seated half-length figure is placed             against a plain background.  His hands and face are emphasized by contrasting the skin tones and the white             shirt against the dark setting.  Facial features are carefully rendered in firm brushstrokes.  The sitter             holds a book on his lap as a symbol of higher learning and his own accomplishments.", "Floyd Hopper was born in Martin County, Indiana.  After graduating from West Baden High School in 1929,             Hopper attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, graduating in 1933.  Hopper was the founder             of the Noblesville Casting Company as well as an artist who painted watercolor landscapes, commissioned             portraits and the American scene with its backyards, alleyways, city streets and workers. He also taught             fine art at the Herron Art School and the Art League.             Hopper painted Blue Monday the same year he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Herron.  The             painting\u2019s title almost certainly refers to the gloomy mood Hopper achieved in his depiction of a backyard             in a rural community at the end of the Depression. Hopper\u2019s use of color powerfully evokes the harsh quality             of the scene.  A pale, dead yellow covers the dried grass and weathered buildings, shadows are painted in             the brown color of used motor oil, and the sky is a smear of smoky tones.  Echoing the blank faces of the             men and women is the blank face of the house in the left background.", "Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his father\u2019s business failed, the family moved to             Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi and             the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. Whether in Paris, Venice, or Boston, Prendergast was attracted to the vivid parade of             everyday life. He became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who included Robert             Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William Glackens.              Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat areas of boldly             contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have been described as             tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight, Prendergast favored             people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Until 1904 he worked almost             exclusively in watercolor. Prendergast earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors             and later oils depicting bustling crowds. Prendergast is one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of             C\u00e9zanne and turn them into his personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  His brother Charles was an             important frame maker whose frames can often be seen on his brother\u2019s work.             Prendergast translated the bustling activity of busy park scenes or passing crowds into flat, bold areas of             percolating color arranged like a loosely knit tapestry of contrasting shapes and forms.  While his             technique became progressively decorative, Prendergast\u2019s themes remained consistent.  The site for Park             Salem  is believed to be a marine park near Salem, Massachusetts.", "Robert Davidson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and apprenticed to his artist-father.  He studied             sculpture at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, The Art Institute of Chicago, the School of             American Sculpture in New York City, and the Bavarian Fine Arts Academy in Munich Germany.  Davidson\u2019s wife,             Maryetta, was an Indiana ceramics artist and also a graduate of John Herron Art Institute.  The couple moved             to Saratoga Spring New York where Davidson taught art at Skidmore College.  During his career, Davidson was             a member of the Indiana Artists Club and the Chicago Artist Association.              The best know of Davidson\u2019s early commissions are large concrete plaques that decorate the fa\u00e7ade of             Indianapolis\u2019 Shortridge High School.  Praying Angel was one of several pieces Davidson placed in national             exhibitions during the 1920s.  The bust\u2019s symmetry, spiritual intensity, and even the limestone material             recall the statuary of Gothic Cathedrals.", "Joseph Mason was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and attended John James Audubon\u2019s classes in drawing in             Cincinnati.  He traveled with Audubon on a flatboat to New Orleans and drew at least fifty flowers for             Audubon\u2019s bird paintings.  Upon his return to Cincinnati and without further training, Mason became a             portrait artist.  In 1834, he left Cincinnati and painted portraits in Michigan and Indiana.  He died of             pneumonia at age thirty-four.             The portrait of Marie Jane Andrew, age, 7, was commissioned in memory of the girl soon after she died.  She             is dressed in an elaborate early Victorian costume and seated among the objects of her childhood; a sewing             box, school books, treasured sea shells, and a Staffordshire pottery figure of a dog.  In addition to             offering a wealth of information about the decorative arts of the period, this portrait is an excellent             example of a self-trained professional portrait artist working in the nineteenth century.  Mason had             difficulty rendering such simple objects as a book, a table top, and a chair in proper perspective.  The             little girl\u2019s extremities, too, are less than convincing.  The artist\u2019s sense of composition and design             makes up for any shortcomings in technique.  The piping on the child\u2019s dress creates an interesting play of             lines with the gold chain about her neck; the window encasements direct the viewer\u2019s eye to her head, the             focal point of the picture.  The portrait is an interesting example of a picture within a picture.  The             painting of a boy in the upper left is believed to be the girl\u2019s brother, James, who had also died very             young.  The distant landscape, seen from the window, is probably their familyl home.", "John Washington Love arrived in Indianapolis with his parents when he was ten years old.  After studying in             the public schools and Northwestern Christian University, Love decided to become an artist.  He entered the             studio of Barton Hays and later went to Cincinnati to continue his studies.  After a year he went to New             York and entered the School of the National Academy of Design.  He then traveled to Paris and was the first             Indiana artist to enter the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the At\u00e9lier G\u00e9r\u00f4me where he studied for four years.              After six years of European study, Love return to Indianapolis and set up the first Indiana School of Art             with fellow artist James F. Gookins. Love\u2019s promising career was cut short with his death at the age of             thirty.             Love\u2019s study of a young boy shows a looser brushwork and more spontaneous approach than that of earlier             figure paintings.  Love\u2019s casual, informal treatment is particularly apparent in the boy\u2019s sidelong glance.              His white collar bring our his facial features that would otherwise be lost in the dark background.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in             separate ferry accidents.

He             continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.              Farmyard Scene displays an unqualified enthusiasm for the vitality, bounty, and sheer visual appeal of rural             life.  Cox continually searched for themes that would appeal to Midwestern patrons, and images of prosperity             derived from working the land must have been popular subjects.  The European style of the architecture in             Farmyard Scene suggests that Cox was probably inspired by Dutch and English painting.  Perhaps he was             striving to elevate the familiar barnyard scenery through associations with Old World culture.  In this             canvas Cox gave prominence to the natural beauty and vigor of the animals and relegated the two women and             the buildings to the shadowed areas of the scene.", "Joseph Oriel Eaton was born in Newark, Ohio.  At the age of sixteen he traveled to Indianapolis and entered             the studio of Jacob Cox.  He moved to Cincinnati and then took a trip to Europe and finally settled in New             York, where he set up his own studio. During his time in Cincinnati Eaton became a very popular portrait             artist.  In New York he developed a reputation as a skillful painter of women\u2019s portraits.  When William             Merritt Chase arrived in New York, he was referred to Eaton for assistance in pursuit of his art career.              Eaton was an associate member of the National Academy of design and a member of the Water Color Society and             Artists\u2019 Fund Society.  Although he painted landscapes and a few neoclassical pieces, Eaton is best known             for his portraits and his free brushwork and sensitive approach.             In the Portrait of Amelia Studley Eaton\u2019s brushstroke appears loose, but the drawing of the sitter\u2019s face             remains firm and solid.  He emphasizes the sitter\u2019s facial features by placing her against a plain             background frames her through the use of a curtain and the fabric on the back of her chair. To move the             viewer around the canvases he repeats the red of the curtain in the woman\u2019s dress and the cloth behind her.              These techniques were used by many successful nineteenth century portrait painters.", "Cecil Head was born near Lebanon, Indiana and graduated from the John Herron Art Institute.  He later shared             a studio with Floyd Hopper and William Kaiser in the Old Union Trust Building on Market Street in             Indianapolis.  The group became known as the Market Street Artists. Early in his career, Head was a             recipient of many art awards including the J. I. Holcomb Prize from the Indianapolis Art Association and the             Ross J. Beatty Prize from the Hoosier Salon.  He was one of the artists selected by Wilbur Peat, director of             the John Herron Art Institute, to represent Indiana in a nationwide exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in             Washington, D. C. After a short time constructing airplane components during World War II, Head settled into             a dual career as a commercial artist and farmer.             Views of railroad tracks, factories and backs of houses were common subjects for many American painters             during the first half of the twentieth-century.  Some artists chose such subjects to portray the social             inequities and the grim ugliness that were part of modern urban life.  Although Buildings in Winter depicts             an alley in a working-class Indianapolis neighborhood, the artist has stated that he was more interested in             achieving a strong composition and rich color scheme than in making a social statement.  Head organized the             blocky, geometric shapes of the buildings into a solid triangle, implied by the convergence of the stairs on             the left and the slope of the roofs on the right. Buildings in Winter was exhibited at the 1939 New York             World\u2019s Fair.", "Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.

Strawberries             exemplifies the artist\u2019s use of strong contrasts of light and dark to enhance the fruit.  He often             incorporated a basket from which the strawberries spilled.  The texture of the berry and the delicacy of its             leaves are superbly captured by Hays who used his  skill to create a realistic image of this lush fruit.", "Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.

C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             Schliersee, a resort tucked into the Alps thirty-eight rail miles southeast of Munich, was a favorite             vacation spot for the Steele family.  From the shores of Schliersee Lake, Steele depicts the picturesque             quality of the town.  Framed by sea and sky, the landscape of farms, cottages and churches is echoed in the             water\u2019s reflections.

There she may have             taught t the Fort Wayne School of Art with her talented relatives the printmakers Jessie and Norah             Hamilton.              This prim lady in a blue suit and rather assertive bonnet won Wagenhals the Art Association of Indianapolis             Purchase Prize in 1916. Although the genteel setting falls within the tradition of interiors painted by the             Boston School artists, the thick, simple strokes used to suggest the visitor\u2019s hands show Wagenhals\u2019             familiarity with bolder painting styles.  The tidy background of straight lines and 90 degree angles             reinforces the impression of propriety.  If not for the sitter\u2019s intelligent expression and alert bearing,             the door in the background might be interpreted as a symbol of a highly desired departure rather than a             welcome arrival.", "Very little is written about Dewey Bates\u2019 life and career.  He was born in Philadelphia and received his art             training in Antwerp, Paris and London.  His move to Indiana was probably influenced by his Indianapolis             relatives and his friendship with John Washington Love, who had been a fellow student in Paris. Both artists             arrived in Indianapolis in 1876. Bates and Love, along with James Gookins helped establish the first Indiana             School of Art in 1877. The school was short-lived and closed after only two years.              The friendship between Bates and Love is apparent in the inscription on this portrait which reads, \u201ca mon             ami, John Love\u201d (to my friend, John Love).  Bates places his subject in a room that is probably an artist\u2019s             studio, possible part of the newly formed Indiana School of Art. The sitter\u2019s casual pose is enhanced by his             outdoor attire and posture and the dog that sits beside the chair gazing up at him."]}]}, "context": {"version": 3, "page_title": null, "page_url": null, "entities": [], "literals": [], "content_hierarchy": []}}
