The rhythmic curving lines of the composition suggest the vitality of nature and are characteristic of Benton\u2019s work .", "Although Hopper is best known for his views of New York interiors and buildings, he also painted landscapes that capture the starkness of rural New England. Devoid of people, Hopper\u2019s landscapes have an abandoned atmosphere that echoes the loneliness and isolation of his urban scenes. This canvas, named after the East Coast railroad line, was painted during the Depression and depicts a landscape and desolate house along the railroad tracks. The prominence of the tracks suggests Hopper\u2019s recurring theme of transience and the solitude of the traveler.", "The colorful patterns and glowing sunshine are signature elements of Frieseke's work.

Strokes of brilliant color are applied with a sensitivity to light and shade acquired from regular outdoor painting. Sharman's current obscurity is hard to understand considering this beautiful scene.", "This is one of three paintings that Garber produced in the late 1920s near Brownsburgh, Pennsylvania. Garber liked the  stark quality  of the setting, and the work's spareness and simplicity creates a sense of mystery. Garber, an Indiana native, was closely associated with the New Hope art colony in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.", "Garber recreated the quarry's raw, craggy features adding an Impressionist play of light across its richly textured surface.

Bishop saw working women as participants in an American tradition of upward mobility and used active brushwork and the figure's physical movement to express this social advancement.", "The free handling of paint, overlapping brush strokes, sun-bleached rocks and vibrant hues exemplify the Impressionist style. Hassam is the most French-inspired American Impressionist in his use of vibrant colors, bright light and broken brushwork.", "With his top hat, spats, and cane, Chase was one of the most dapper and cosmopolitan artists of his day.

The model is the artist\u2019s daughter Eleanor, who often joined her mother and sisters in posing for Benson\u2019s outdoor works around Wooster Farm, their summer retreat in Maine. Benson was a key figure in Boston\u2019s art scene, both as a highly successful artist and director of the Museum of Fine Art\u2019s school. Like colleagues Edmund Tarbell and William Paxton, his purest Impressionist efforts are depictions of women and children in sun-drenched landscapes.", "Indianapolis native William Scott studied in France with the celebrated African American artist Henry O.

This canvas recalled the romantic spirit in which many men went off to battle.", "Higgins exhibits the influence of cubism in his use of geometric shapes enhanced by strong contrasts of light and dark. The artist was affected by the 1913 New York armory show, where he came in contact with European and American Modernism.", "Chase relished painting his family, and the pictures of his wife and daughters are among his most memorable canvases. This portrait of Chase's daughter Dorothy is one of several full-length images with subdued color schemes and unadorned backgrounds that he painted between 1886 and 1902.", "The dark, brooding tone is typical of Whittredge's German work.

The artist was a modernist painter associated with Alfred Stieglitz and his New York galleries.", "The Pioneers resemble a style of British landscape painting known as  picturesque,  which features images such as the shadowy valley, rugged woodcutters, twisted trees and romantic stone ruins. English-born Shaw painted the branches and leaves with a delicate touch.", "The statue's elegant face and poised bearing have the grace and dignity of the neo-classical ideal.

Inness followed the teachings of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, who theorized that objects in the material world exist in a parallel spiritual realm.", "The lighter tonalities and tighter brushwork are characteristic of Chase's early work. Based on the strength of his still lifes, a group of St. Louis businessmen sponsored Chase's education at the Munich Royal Academy in 1872. Although flowers occasionally reappear in the artist's output, his reputation as a still life painter was secured by his bravura depictions of fish.", "This canvas is perhaps the only panoramic underwater scene in 19th-century American art, and it is the aquatic equivalent of a Hudson River School landscape. Moran may have been inspired by underwater exploration related to the laying of the first successful telegraph cable in 1858.", "Gilbert Stuart Portrait of A Family, ca. 1783 - 1793 oil on canvas 50 x 40 in.

Born in North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took him to Scotland, but his mentor\u2019s death forced Stuart back to America.  During the Revolutionary War, he returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West.  As success came, so did debt which forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important political figures.  One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the \u201cAthenaeum Head\u201d currently on the dollar bill. In this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British portraiture.  The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boy\u2019s jacket move the viewer\u2019s eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures.

Miniature portraits have been used as mementos since ancient times.", "Here, a group of Potawatomi Indians gather next to the Wabash River.  The figures are posed in a casual setting, reflecting Winter's goal to record the daily life and customs of these people. Winter was born in England and came to America in 1830 to study in New York.  In 1837 he moved to Logansport, Indiana.", "In this landscape Adams pursues the impressionist goal of capturing the light and atmosphere of a specific moment. Thornberry's Pasture is in Brooklyn, Indiana a few miles southwest of Indianapolis. Adams was the first painting instructor at the John Herron Art Institute.", "Hilliard was a versatile painter of portraits, landscapes, still lifes and animals. The slightly unbalanced, casual arrangement of the flowers suggests Hilliard was aware of Japanese design. Hilliard came to Madison, Indiana from Auburn, New York at age twenty.  He arrived in Indianapolis ten years later and then went to Boston and Europe.", "The subject of this painting resembles a nativity scene with Mary, baby Jesus, and Joseph in a landscape setting. Glessing was a painter of theatrical scenery and landscapes. When this scene was painted, the artist was in Indianapolis decorating the Metropolitan Theatre, which later became the Park.", "The artist's mother was the first guest and subject of the first portrait the artist painted in his new studio and summer residence at Shinnecock, Long Island, in 1892. The lace cap was added by Chase to cover a spot he had overlooked, but its delicate texture and bow also soften the sitter's features. Chase taught the first outdoor school of landscape painting at Shinnecock.", "Couse is best known for his intimate images of Native Americans in quiet repose. The artist's paint strokes set up a rhythmic flow, which moves throughout the work. Tradition holds that the Taos Indians were created out of the sacred waters of Blue Lake.", "Fechin developed a dramatic style consisting of vigorous brush strokes and vivid colors. The artist loved the somber forests near his home in Russia and found their equivalent in the New Mexico Plateau, where he settled in 1927. The Pueblo Indians rekindled Fechin's interest in the culture and heritage of native peoples.", "Portia's fashionable hat, with its veil stretched tightly over her face and head, is in keeping with Du Bois' tendency to reduce human forms to a few simplified shapes. The sitter is dressed in a style that echoes her high social standing. Du Bois was an art critic as well as an artist.", "This ambitious portrait presents the members of the Hoosier group, (from left to right) T. C. Steele, Otto Stark, J. Ottis Adams and William Forsyth.  Richard Gruelle had died seven years earlier. The artists are posed as if they were choosing paintings for an art exhibition.", "Eugene Ullman's style resembles that of his teachers, William Merritt Chase and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. In this painting the artist combines the dark tonalities of the figure and background to create an elegant portrait.  Ullman spent most of his career in France.", "This painting is an Indian-style version of the Oriental harem woman, a voluptuous figure reclining in luxurious surroundings. The title gives the picture a touch of anecdotal humor. Russell and Frederick Remington were the most renowned artists of the American West.", "This is an idealized portrait of a seventeen-year-old Indian boy who later became Chief of the Taos Pueblo. The boy is shown drying a bird's brain to create a talisman that will guarantee his future success. Sharp documented Indian tribal life and ritual.", "Remington portrayed this horse and rider with a keen sense of drama, capturing the perils of descending down a steep mountain slope. This scene is portrayed as realistically as the sculptor's art permits. The West's most daring explorers, trappers, and traders were known as mountain men.", "The foreboding quality of the forest and the three tiny spotlighted figures, frozen in poses of fright and struggle, suggest the aftermath of a disaster. The use of the explosive material pyroxylin, a fast drying duco, is in keeping with the artist's image of forces beyond man's control.", "This figure exemplifies the straightforward unidealized portraits favored by Henri. The woman in this canvas lived off the coast of Ireland, where Henri and his wife vacationed. Henri led the Ashcan School, a group of artists who focused on gritty urban realism.", "The seated half-length figure, plain background and emphasis on hands and face are elements of early American portraits. Hoosier artist Barton Hays began his career tinting photographs and painting over enlarged prints.", "In this painting, two soothsayers of ancient Greece, called Bacidae, study the entrails of a bird for signs of the future. Dodson's work is based on dramatic themes from the Bible, history and classical mythology.", "Although Dines learned to paint from his Danish-American father, Emile, both artists produced tonal arrangements inspired by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and 17th-century Dutch masters. In this painting, Whistler's influence is especially apparent in the artist's use of a limited palette of yellow, black and green, and the simplified composition.", "The sitter is posed in a romantic setting wearing fashionable attire, but Peale did not soften her intense gaze or prominent nose. Helen and her husband founded McLean Seminary, a girls' school in Indianapolis. Peale was a member of a Philadelphia family of prominent American painters.", "With its emphasis on profile and clean geometric shapes, Indian Hunter exhibits Manship's enthusiasm for archaic Greek sculpture. The sculpture's rhythmic contours create the sensation of movement. Manship is best known for his gilded statue of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center in New York.", "The fluid brush and broken color, as well as the birds-eye view perspective, all indicate Goodwin's debt to Impressionism. The subject refers to one of the many parades held to raise funds for America's war efforts. This canvas is a view of Arlington Street as it borders Boston Gardens Park.", "Famous for his mobiles and stabiles, the sculptor Alexander Calder was also a notable painter. Calder's work displays a free and whimsical spirit. The two keyhole-shaped vibrantly colored, geometric figures transform a simple design into a dream image.", "The portrait is an essay in subtle earth tones accented by the woman\u2019s long dangling earring. The simple flourish that suggests the figure\u2019s right hand demonstrates Bell\u2019s adept brushwork. This figure study exemplifies Bell\u2019s early work and Munich School training.", "To emphasize the untouched quality of the American wilderness, Codman dramatized the Indian's prowess in his native environment. This landscape surrounded by trees and mountains is a composite of specific and imagined forms, some drawn from prints and literary sources.", "The sitter's dress and coiffure reflect the new American aristocracy's desire to legitimize itself through association with historical styles of ancient Greece and Rome. Stuart's portraits of George Washington and Federalist families in Philadelphia and Washington secured his place in history.", "The stylized hair and soft rounded forms are in harmony with the images of the sea, the goddess, and Art Deco sculpture of the 1920s and 1930s. This small bronze figure is tied to the mythological goddess of love and her birth from the foam of the sea.", "De Luce was a noted portrait and genre painter. An Anxious Mother is a typical Victorian scene of a child at play. This is the first painting acquired by the museum after it was founded in 1883.", "This scene is composed of flat, simplified forms, vibrant colors and geometric patterns. Lawrence, one of the nation's most important African American artists, excelled in making paintings and prints of contemporary life. During the Depression Lawrence focused on the tenement house in New York's Harlem.", "Women in a sunlit landscape framed by a large, vividly patterned Japanese parasol, exemplify Miller's expressionist technique. Miller was one of the American Impressionists working in the French countryside known as the Giverny Group.", "The sharp lines, geometric shapes and flat areas of color place Rooftops within the Precisionist style. Precisionism was influenced by industrial development, such as skyscrapers and factories, and shows images painted with machine-like quality frozen in time like a photograph.", "The artist translated the activities of everyday life into a loosely knit tapestry of flat, bold areas of color. Prendergast preferred the medium of watercolor. The site for this watercolor is probably a nature park near Salem, Massachusetts.", "With loose, fluid brushstrokes, the artist depicts the boats, cottages, and shore of this harbor, while still emphasizing the flat surface of the canvas Hawthorne studied under William Merritt Chase and helped run Chase\u2019s Long Island school before founding the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The town attracted many artists, and Hawthorne became known as the \u201cfather\u201d of the art colony. Paintings of Provincetown fishermen executed in a more somber palette so dominate the artist\u2019s work that this lively, vibrant painting of Hyannisport, a town 50 miles away, represents an intriguing contrast.", "Mary Cassatt received her early training in America, but settled in Paris, where she exhibited with the Impressionists in the late 1870s. Children and motherhood provided the primary themes for Cassatt's work. She successfully avoided sentimentalized views of childhood, focusing instead on her subjects freshness, intelligence and energy. Like her mentor Edgar Degas, Cassatt worked well in pastel, a medium that utilized her drawing skills and refined sense of texture.", "Marsh employed a graphic, linear technique to bring individuality to the travelers. The newspaper headline refers to the sentencing of the convicted kidnapper of Charles Lindbergh's baby. Marsh's artistic inspiration derived from his study of European Old Master painters.", "This canvas, with its intricate linear construction, exhibits the artist's dramatic use of brilliant color. Pueblo people used parrots as a source of feathers to decorate ceremonial objects. Indiana-born Higgins gained his fame as a Western artist painting in Taos, New Mexico.", "Three nameless guests and a desk clerk occupy the disquieting, airless space of Hotel Lobby. The cheerlessness of the foyer is enhanced by the lack of rapport among the figures. Hopper is renowned for paintings infused with loneliness and banality.", "In this portrait Eaton's brushstrokes appear loose, but the drawing of the sitter's facial features remains firm and solid. Eaton spent only a short time in Indianapolis, during which he studied under Jacob Cox.  He eventually settled in New York. The artist developed a reputation as a skillful painter of women's portraits.", "The dark tonalities and unadorned background are typical of nineteenth century portraiture. The delicate lace neckline fastened with a cameo pin and the tiny drop earring soften the dark tonality of this portrait. The Sewells were residents of Covington, Indiana.", "The simple, direct manner, combined with firm brushwork and the careful attention to detail in the sitter's beard, hair and glasses, is evidence of Hays' skill as a portrait painter. Much of Hays' renown came from his having tutored William Merritt Chase, but his reputation rested on the quality of his portraits and fruit still lifes.", "Leigh was known as the  Sagebrush Rembrandt  due to his use of traditional European techniques.  The dark tonalities in this work reflect his training at the Royal Academy in Munich. The artist strongly disliked modern, abstract art. Leigh focused on the culture and traditions of the Hopi and Navajo Indians.", "Recognized primarily for his Cubist-inspired sculpture, Archipenko also featured the disjunctive planes and irregular contours of Cubism in his paintings, such as Promenade. Archipenko worked in Europe until emigrating to the United States in 1923.", "Mary Cassatt received her early training in America but settled in Paris, where she befriended Edgar Degas and exhibited with the Impressionists. Young children were among Cassatt's favorite subjects, though she avoided sentimental portrayals in favor of emphasizing her models' freshness, intelligence, and energy. This pastel is one in a series of portraits of children who lived in the French village where Cassatt spent her summers.", "The stately composition and solid forms give the subject a dignity not often associated with fish markets. Hawthorne's green-toned palette evokes the sea and emphasizes by contrasting color the bloody business at hand. This man was a Portuguese resident of the Cape Cod village where Hawthorne spent most of his career.", "Instead of the smooth finish that lends French nudes their remote idealism, this figure is brushed with ruddy reflections of the walls, giving her flesh a sensuous realism, and suggesting Paxton's attraction to Impressionism. A transitional work, this nude predates most of the elegant interior scenes for which Paxton and his Boston School colleagues are best known.", "The subject's origins in nature are suggested through color and texture and the repetition and layering of forms, which create a rhythm reminiscent of fluttering wings. Indiana-born Stevens was originally a landscape painter who eventually produced works that expressed nature in an abstract manner.", "The casual pose of the portrait allows Love's personality to emerge. The setting may have been a studio in the newly formed Indiana School of Art, the state's first art school. Bates and Love settled in Indianapolis after studying together in Paris."]}, {"index": 13, "name": "provenance", "values": ["Purchase from Perls Gallery, New York, on April 6, 1962, by Frank C.

When Henri was ten years old, his father, a gambler and real estate promoter, shot someone in self defense.  The family feared for their safety, moved to Atlantic City, New Jersey, changed their name and passed their two sons off as adopted children.  Robert Henri chose a variation on his middle name as his surname and attended boarding school in New York City.  He received his art training at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then attended the Academy Julian in Paris.  After spending several years in Europe, Henri taught at the Chase School of Art and the New York School of Art where he led a fight against Academic views.  In 1909, Henri established his own school and organized \u201cThe Eight,\u201d a group of artists that rejected the restraints from the National Academy of Design.  The Eight favored a style that portrayed contemporary everyday life.  Five members of this group, including Henri, became known as the Ashcan School because of their depictions of the seedy side of life.  Henri favored portraits of ordinary people, while the remainder of the group focused primarily on everyday street scenes. This portrait of professional model Edna Smith is typical of Henri\u2019s ability to capture his subject\u2019s spirit.  Around 1909, Henri adopted the color system of theorist Hardesty Maratta, which assigns a letter and number to 144 harmonically related colors.  Painters could use the system of letters and number to carefully plan the color relationships of their paintings.  The rich harmonies of this image based on red and green show Henri\u2019s use of the Maratta system.", "Edmund Brucker was born in Cleveland, Ohio and trained at the Cleveland School of Art.  He was an accomplished painter working in a realist style when he joined the faculty of the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he taught until his retirement. Though he was best known as a portrait painter, Brucker also painted regional scenes in both oil and watercolor.  Many of his works combine views from sketches and drawings he made of different sites during different times of the day.  His palette of rich gray tones emphasizes design, composition and line. As a portraitist, Brucker painted Indiana governor Matthew E. Welsh as well as family, friends. He painted several portraits of African Americans, other local citizens and fellow artists. Monday Morning is an example of the more modernist idiom Brucker experiments with during the 1940s.  Elements of cubism and a design as precise as an architect\u2019s are present in the painting\u2019s ruler straight lines, angularity, and compressed space.  Like other American artists of the time, Brucker painted back alleys and industrial landscapes, views which seem to capture the stress-filled American society of the 1930s and 1940s.  The bright green spot of vegetation in the center of Brucker\u2019s subdued colors and geometric shapes stands out as a symbol of nature and regeneration amid the urban environment.  Brucker\u2019s inspiration for Monday Morning was a sketch he made on a sunny day in the Little Italy section of Cleveland, Ohio.  Monday Morning was exhibited widely, including, in 1947 at the annual national art competition sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.", "John Sloan was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania and moved with his family to Philadelphia where he attended Central High School.  He worked for a print dealer and as a newspaper illustrator. Sloan studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts where he met Robert Henri, and moved to New York to become a part of Henri\u2019s urban realist circle. Under Henri\u2019s leadership Sloan and seven other artists opposed the traditional hold that that the National Academy of Design had exerted over art in America.  In 1908 the group, which became known as The Eight held an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery in New York.  Sloan and four other members of the group painted down-to-earth subject matter which earned them the epithet of Ashcan School, because critics felt their art was offensive. The Ashcan School artists recorded the bustling activity of New York\u2019s lower East Side with broad, vigorous strokes and a conscious avoidance of sentimentality. Sloan taught at the Art Student\u2019s League passing on his style of urban subject matter to Reginald Marsh and Raphael Soyer, who followed in their teacher\u2019s footsteps. Red Kimono on the Roof, an unglorified glimpse of a woman, clothespin in mouth, attending to her laundry, may have been painted from Sloan\u2019s studio window, which would explain the elevated vantage point.  The picture\u2019s sense of immediacy and direct observation is enhanced by the spontaneous brushwork and Sloan\u2019s attention to light and shadow.", "Arthur B. Davies was born in Utica, New York and exhibited his talent for painting when he was sixteen.  His family moved to Chicago where he studied at the Art Institute.  He went to New York City and continued his studies at the Art Students League, where he met Robert Henri and George Luks.  As with many of the artists who would later make up the group known as The Eight, Davies began his career as an illustrator.  He discovered his distinctive style of the female nude in a landscape setting around the turn of the twentieth-century.  Symbolic and poetic, these figures were posed in a frieze-like manner against mysteriously dark backgrounds and seemed to have their roots in mythology.  In 1908, Davies joined a group of artists at an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery which established these artists as \u201cThe Eight.\u201d  Davies became president of the Society of Independent Artists and helped organize the 1913 Armory Show, which introduced the American public to European avant-garde trends.  While Cubism had a short and minor influence on Davies, he continued to focus on the idyllic figures that were the hallmark of his style. Many of Davies\u2019 paintings exude a dream-like quality of detachment from the everyday world. In Across the Harbor the artist painted a group of female figures, posing their stylized forms in the frieze-like composition he often favored.  The unusual color scheme and the abrupt change of scale presented by the sailboat heighten the painting\u2019s vague sense of otherworldly mystery.", "Constance Coleman Richardson grew up in Irvington, Indiana, where her father was director of the Indiana State Historical Commission.  After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education.  The compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston Richardson.  After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years.  After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the Pennsylvania Academy.  During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects.  Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums. Richardson recalled that the site of this painting was the front yard of her family\u2019s home at 4314 North Central in Indianapolis. Yet Richardson\u2019s lush green neighborhood scene transcends any specific place to become a symbol of traditional middle-class America during the 1930s. The yards are large and well tended, and the house across the street, characteristic of the days before air conditioning, has a broad, striped awning.  Girls in dresses play under the streetlight, a watchful mother include din its reassuring glow.  Richardson\u2019s vision of the scene reduces figures, trees, even shadows to simplified geometric forms.  The result is a painting that breathes the essence of a summer evening.  Very little imagination is required to hear the gentle nocturnal sounds of crickets and cicadas.", "J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.  Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region\u2019s artists.  In 1898, Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901, Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from 1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.     Shown in New York in 1886, Wash Day, Bavaria is the first painting Adams sent to America for exhibition.  It may be surprising the artist would have chosen this kind of simple scene from everyday life for his debut.  The the diagonal lines of the grass and clothesline draw the viewer to the woman hanging her laundry.  Although the forms are solidly rendered in the academic tradition, this sunlit canvas is brighter and richer in tonality than the dark scenarios preferred by the Royal Academy.  Adams always favored Wash Day, Bavaria and hung it in a place of prominence in his studio when he returned to Muncie.", "Ruth Pratt Bobbs was born into a moneyed family in Indianapolis, Indiana. When she was eight years old, her mother took her to Saturday art school.  At sixteen, after the death of her parents, Bobbs went to Paris, where she studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian.  She returned to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League.  By the time she came back to Indianapolis to continue her training at the John Herron Art Institute, Bobbs had studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri, Kenyon Cox and Frank Vincent DuMond.  She also worked with Charles Webster Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts.  At twenty-eight she married William C. Bobbs, president of the Bobbs-Merrill publishing company, a man twenty-three years her senior. After the death of her husband in 1926, Bobbs went back to Paris and opened a studio.  When she returned to Indianapolis, Bobbs opened a studio and gallery where she painted portraits of local citizens, entrepreneurs, and government leaders. Despite coming from a wealthy family and marrying into wealth, which created a great deal of skepticism regarding her sincerity as an artist, Bobbs proved she was serious by becoming a very successful portrait painter. When this figure study hung in Bobb\u2019s Indianapolis living room, visitors often mistook it for a self portrait from her youth.  Although the sitter\u2019s hat and cape did belong to the artist, the model was a young woman named Jesseca Penn.  While a student in New York, Bobbs met the Scotswoman who had just come to this country and was looking for work.  Bobbs painted her and then sent her to pose for Robert Henri who was teaching at the Chase School in New York.  The \u201cread-haired model,\u201d as she was later known, became a favorite of Henri and posed for many of his best pictures.  The Japanese screen, a stock motif employed by Bobbs\u2019s teachers in Boston and New York, creates the bright tones that suffuse the picture.  Its vertical and diagonal bamboo stalks echo the lines of the sitter, deftly integrating the figure with the background.", "William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city\u2019s Royal Academy.  In 1878, Chase returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style.  He was a member of America\u2019s influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely influential teacher.  Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in Shinnecock, Long Island.  He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Charles Sheeler. In 1870 Chase moved to St. Louis, where his family had relocated after losing their shoe business in Indianapolis.  He hoped to support himself by satisfying the Victorian taste for still-life paintings of flowers and fruit.  This early example of Chase\u2019s still-life painting suggests his awareness of other American artists.  The hummingbird motif probably derives from the work of Martin Johnson Heade, and the bouquet recalls John LaFarge\u2019s floral arrangements.  Chase considered flowers \u201cthe most difficult\u201d things to paint, which may account for their scarcity in his work. Yet in 1872 his success in still-life painting induced a group of local patrons to allow Chase to resume this education by sponsoring his attendance at the Royal Academy in Munich.", "Jacob Hegler arrived in the Midwest around 1845 after emigrating from Switzerland.  He undoubtedly studied drawing and painting before coming to America but did not turn to painting as a full-time vocation until settling in Indiana.  He enjoyed great success as a portrait painting in the Wabash River town of Attica, Indiana in the mid 1850s. While in Attica, Hegler received a commission from Dr. Lewis Lyons to paint his daughter Alice.  He posed the little girl and her dog against a background of country road and woodland. Dr. Lyons was a physician and one of the town's prominent citizens. Every detail of the velvet-braided Victorian frock, the careful smoothed curls and lace-ruffled pantalets is depicted in the precise, quaint fashion of the day. Her serious expression reflects the mid-nineteenth century concept of children as small adults.  The rugged landscape setting is a reminder of the frontier conditions that existed in parts of Indiana during the 1850s. Roger G. Wolcott of Indianapolis purchased this canvas from the owner of the old Lyons home, and donated it to the IMA.", "David Rubins was born in Minneapolis and received his education at Dartmouth College.  He then traveled to Europe to continue his studies at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and Acad\u00e9mie Julian.  Rubins was also a fellow in sculpture at the American Academy in Rome.  His sculpture was primarily figurative and included a monument of Abraham Lincoln as a young man for the Indiana State Capitol and the bronze cherub that was on the clock during Christmas season at L. S. Ayres and Company in downtown Indianapolis. Rubins is also known for his busts of prominent people, including the architect Evans Woolen, President William Henry Harrison and Indianapolis Governor Henry Schricker.  Rubins taught sculpture and anatomy at the Herron School of Art in Indianapolis. In his figural sculpture, Rubins usually sought harmonious proportions and a pensive quality, preferring rounded, ideal forms to the angular or distorted.  The balance and feminine grace of this bronze figure recall early twentieth-century French sculpture by artists such as Aristide Mailllol.", "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds. The Bloom of the Grape, painted in Vernon, Indiana, in early November 1893 during what Steele called \u201ca glorious autumn,\u201d is the artist\u2019s best-known landscape.  Its title refers to the white gauzy veil, known as \u201cbloom,\u201d covering grapes at harvest time.  Steele wrote to his wife that he had never seen better color, \u201csuch dull reads and crimsons and faded yellows and oranges, in juxtaposition with such royal purples.\u201d These rich color harmonies are captured in this painting in a manner that critic Charles F. Browne described as conservatively impressionistic, but not wild.  The luminosity and color harmonies found in Bloom of the Grape exemplify the new approach to landscape painting that would earn Steele national recognition for his modified Impressionist style.", "George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon hearing of the plight of northern Indiana\u2019s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what became known as \u201cPotawatomi Trail of Death,\u201d Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana to document their culture.  After thirteen years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose not only convey the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.  The IMA collection contains several paintings by George Winter two of which are titled Scene on the Wabash.  Both of these works portray a group of Potawatomi Indians gathered next to the Wabash River. The figures are posed in a casual setting, reflecting Winter\u2019s goal of recording the daily life and customs of these people. This particular painting concentrates on family activities, particularly women washing clothes in the Wabash.  It exemplifies the type of gathering of the Potawatomi that established Winter\u2019s reputation as an artist.", "Born in Nova Scotia, Ernest Lawson spent his youth in Ontario.  He joined his physician father in Kansas City and began studying at the Kansas City Art Institute.  Lawson traveled to Mexico with his father working as a draftsman and studying at the Santa Clara Art Academy and then went to New York to enroll at the Art Students League.  Lawson spent time at the summer school of Cos Cob, Connecticut where he began painting out of doors.  He travelled to France to continue his studies in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and shared a studio with Somerset Maugham, who used Lawson as the prototype for Frederic Lawson in his novel, \u201cOf Human Bondage.\u201d  After returning to New York, Lawson settled in Washington Heights, an area he painted numerous times.  Lawson continued traveling, spending time in France, Spain and in New England painting in Cos Cob, Connecticut and Cornish, New Hampshire.  He taught at The Art Institute in Kansas City and Broadmoor Academy.  Lawson was one of the members of \u201cThe Eight\u201d who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in 1908. He was one of the three artists in this group who is not considered an Ashcan School painter, because of his focus on impressionist landscapes rather than the urban realist subjects that fascinated his fellow artists.   April may depict a stretch of the Harlem River near Lawson\u2019s home in Washington Heights, New York.  Lawson had studied with American Impressionist John Twachtman and adopted his practice of building up paint in a thick crust of interwoven cover. The pastel yellow-greens, blue-greens and pinks contrast with a few patches of dark purple and blue and ably convey the look of a cool, soggy day in early spring.", "Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his father\u2019s business failed, the family came to Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi and the Acad\u00e9mie Julian.  Prendergast became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who included Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William Glackens.  Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat areas of boldly contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have been described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight, Prendergast favored people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Prendergast earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors and oils depicting bustling crowds.  He is remembered today as one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of C\u00e9zanne and turn them into his personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  Prendergast\u2019s brother Charles was an important frame maker whose frames can often be seen on his brother\u2019s work. In Glimpse of the Harbor, Gloucester, Prendergast handles this watercolor view of the Massachusetts harbor with typical freedom, wielding thin washes in loosely knit strokes and allowing broad areas of the white paper to figure in the composition. Patterns contrast between rigid geometry and curvilinear forms.  The people are characteristically blended into the scene so they do not disturb the rhythm of the composition.", "George Luks was born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania and received his first art instruction from his parents who painted as a hobby.  His formal education began at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.  He also traveled to London and Paris returning to the United States to work as an artist for Philadelphia newspapers.  He roomed with fellow illustrator Everett Shinn and became acquainted with George Luks, William Glackens, John Sloan and later Robert Henri who, along with Shinn, became known as the Philadelphia Five.  Luks also drew comic strips, but gave up illustration to become a full time artist.  His career as an illustrator drew his interests to painting urban street scenes. Luks had a vibrant, sometime raucous, personality that is expressed in his lively portraits and urban subjects.  He joined Robert Henri\u2019s circle in their depictions of city life and became part of the Ashcan School.   He was also a member of the rebellious group known as \u201cThe Eight\u201d who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in New York in 1908.  Because Luks was a heavy drinker, he became involved in a barroom brawl that ended in his death. New Year\u2019s Shooter dates from around the first exhibition of The Eight, who had banded together to oppose the rigid formulas of academic painting.  He shared with Robert Henri an energetic brushwork, patterned after the dynamic seventeenth-century Dutch painter Frans Hals.  Luks sympathized with the powerless \u2013 immigrants, the poor, children \u2013 and was at his best when portraying them.  The colorful palette of New Year\u2019s Shooter is in tune with the gaiety and theatricality of the subject.", "George Bellows was born in Columbus, Ohio and attended Ohio State University where he provided illustrations for the school\u2019s student yearbook.  Before graduating, he left Ohio State to study art in New York City where he became a student of Robert Henri at the New York School of Art.  Bellows became associated with Henri\u2019s group which was known as \u201cThe Eight\u201d and the Ashcan School. He taught at the Art Student League of New York, while painting urban New York scenes depicting working-class people.  His most important work was his series of paintings portraying amateur boxing matches. Bellows\u2019s fame grew and he began to receive portrait commissions from wealthy New Yorkers.  In addition to painting, Bellows made important contributions to lithography and created more than 100 images. During his later career, he illustrated a number of books, including several by H. G. Wells.  Portrait of a Boy depicts Meredith Hare, the young son of a wealthy family living in Tuxedo Park, New York.  In a letter to his wife, Bellows wrote that Mrs. Hare had asked for a picture of her son in a stiff white collar and formal pose.  Bellows fulfilled her request but then executed this portrait, which reveals the details of loose, soft clothing, tousled hair and inquisitive expression, the sitter\u2019s charmingly boyish character.  Unable to decide which portrait she preferred, Mrs. Hare took neither.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in separate ferry accidents.  Cox\u2019s grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians.  By that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox\u2019s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.  Brook in Summer reflects Cox\u2019s high regard for traditional, pastoral landscapes filled with lush scenery and soft light.  Cox varies the format of the traditional landscape by placing the trees, bushes and fallen branches randomly, as they appear in nature, rather than in an idealized order.  This setting is probably a composite of sketches of the Indianapolis countryside and views invented by Cox.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in separate ferry accidents.

Cox\u2019s portrait of Charles H. Brewer hung in his son Charles\u2019s home for fifty-five years before it was offered as a gift to the IMA.  The family recounts that the elder Brewer was about twelve years old when Cox painted him.  According to Brewer\u2019s son, the artist finished the painting in his studio, added the fishing rod and dog, which did not belong to the sitter.  Such attributes, including the imaginary landscape in the background, were common practices in nineteenth century portraiture and served to enhance the sitter\u2019s status or, in this case, add to the image of a childhood.", "T.

In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds. Pleasant Run has been called the masterpiece of Steele\u2019s Munich manner.  It was painted within months of the artist\u2019s return from five years of study in Germany, where he became increasingly devoted to painting from nature.  The canvas\u2019s dark tonalities, backlighting, and even its composition, relate to Steele\u2019s scenes of Bavaria.  Yet as the artist noted in his journal, he remained sensitive to the nuances of the Indiana landscape, carefully recording its color contrasts and clear light.  In 1885 when T. C. Steele painted this landscape, Pleasant Run defined the eastern and southern limits of Indianapolis.  The area depicted here was located just north of Irvington at the southwest corner of what is now Arlington and Tenth Street.", "William Forsyth was born in California, Ohio, not far from Cincinnati. His early use of the family\u2019s walls as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity.  When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis.  Forsyth started his art studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen.  He earned his living painting houses with his brother and used his free time to explore his artistic talents.  Forsyth became on of the first student in the newly established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school.  His desire for more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the Royal Academy.

When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.  After the school closed, Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933.  Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the Depression.  In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later. In 1883 William Forsyth entered the Technical Painting Class of Ludwig von L\u00f6fftz, where he received a full grounding the painting of portrait heads and figure studies.  In this canvas painted about midway through his six-year stay in Europe, Forsyth focuses on the time-worn quality of the woman\u2019s hands and facial features.  Old Market Woman exemplifies the Munich School\u2019s dark tonality and bravura brushwork, derived from the 17th-century Dutch portraits of Rembrandt and Hals.", "Determined to be an artist, Scudder left Terre Haute, Indiana in her teens to study at the Academy of Art in Cincinnati.  By age 20 she was one of Lorado Taft\u2019s \u201cwhite rabbits,\u201d the female assistants who aided him in his many sculpture projects for the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  In 1894 she sought training in France, where she eventually established her home and studio.  Active beyond her work as a sculptor, Scudder participated in the women\u2019s suffrage movement in the United States, wrote an autobiography entitled Modelling My Life, and was honored by France as a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur.  Scudder came back to the United States nearly every year to seek fountain projects from landscape architects. During the early 20th century a wide-spread American demand for garden sculpture provided Scudder with many commissions, earning her the title \u201cWoman of the Fountains.\u201d As a young artist in France, Scudder persuaded the successful American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies to break his rule against taking students. Scudder incorporated MacMonnies lively naturalistic modeling into Frog Fountain. She said that this bronze was inspired by children she observed in Italy, a country renowned for its fountain sculpture.  The chubby little boy, his hair garlanded with flowers, dances between three nervous frogs. Frog Fountain is Scudder\u2019s best known work, and this bronze is one of many replicas.", "Forrest Stark was born in Wisconsin and began his art training at the Wisconsin School of Art in Milwaukee and was also a graduate of Milwaukee State Teachers\u2019 College.  He continued his training at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Art Students League in New York.  After completing his study at the Pennsylvania Academy, Stark was awarded the Cresson scholarship to study and travel in Europe.  He became head of the sculpture department and instructor in oil still life painting at the John Herron Art Institute.  Stark produced work in sculpture, pastels, watercolors and oils. This portrait bust was completed in the last year of Forysth\u2019s life.  No longer \u201ccocky,\u201d as he often was accused of being, Forsyth was old, sad and disillusioned over the loss of his position as teacher at Herron.

The scene may depict the landing at Madison, Indiana.  Relying on his extensive outdoor painting experience, Forsyth created the intense, humid light of a landscape painted directly from nature.  His animated brushwork belies the fact that he was physically weakened by his heart attack.", "Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in Franklin, Indiana.  He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich\u2019s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States, where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of forty-three. The course of study in the Technical Painting Class at the Royal Academy in Munich consisted of rigorous instruction in the painting of heads, followed by full figure work.  This procedure continued the teaching methods begun in the drawing classes, where the major portion of the day was spent rendering portrait studies of elderly peasant types.  Using the masters of Dutch 17th-century portraiture, Rembrandt and Hals, as prototypes, L\u00f6fftz had his students restrict the basic harmony of their paintings to soft, shadowy grays, relieved only by sharp details in the highlights.  Here the contours of the man\u2019s white shirt stand out against the dark tonalities and ease the severity of the composition.", "Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in Franklin, Indiana.  He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich\u2019s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States, where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of forty-three. At the Royal Academy, Professor von L\u00f6fftz\u2019s perfectionism was legendary. Emphasizing the dark tonalities of the Old Dutch Masters, he demanded that his students restrict their palettes to carefully modulated browns, ochres, grays, and off-whites with the intention of reigning in impulses toward harsh local colors.  His policy of reducing color to a narrow range of harmonies drove the more impulsive students to distraction.   A Swiss artist complained: \u201cIn my study of that woman I was well on my way to losing the color altogether as I continually tried to subdue the tone toward gray.\u201d  Such struggles are evident in Richards\u2019s portraits with their emphasis on dark tonalities devoid of high key color.", "Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.

His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of forty-three. The carefully delineated facial features of this model are in stark contrast to the loose, animated strokes that define his hair and clothes. Richard\u2019s free handling of the paint makes it difficult to differentiate between the man\u2019s attire and his long flowing beard.  While the model\u2019s face exemplifies the perfect outline found in the work of German Renaissance artist Albrecht D\u0171rer, the rest of the canvas exhibits the influence of the bravura brushwork associated with the 17th-century Dutch painter Franz Hals.  These seemingly opposing influences combined to form the dominant style of the Royal Academy know as Munich realism.", "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds. The young woman in Steele\u2019s canvas represents a departure from the Royal Academy\u2019s preference for older models.  This attractive figure, whose youthful facial features emerge from the dark shadows, is rendered in brown tonalities against an unadorned, dark background.  The setting and execution exemplify the austere style espoused by Germany\u2019s Royal Academy teachers.  L\u00f6fftz was prone to severe criticism of the \u201csweet color\u201d in his students\u2019 work and praised such somber and meditative images as Munich Girl.", "George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon hearing of the plight of northern Indiana\u2019s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what became known as \u201cPotawatomi Trail of Death,\u201d Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their culture.  After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.  Winter\u2019s arrival in Logansport, Indiana, coincided with the last months of the Potawatomi in Indiana.  His ambition to record, with an ethnographer\u2019s attention to detail, the daily life and customs of the Wabash Potawatomi resulted in scores of drawings, made between 1837 and 1838, which served as the basis for Indian paintings such as Scene on the Wabash. The Potawatomi\u2019s contented expressions are at odds with the overall melancholy of the barren landscape.  Winter often included a dead tree in his Potawatomi pictures as a symbol of their removal from native lands.", "Ketcham took an early interest in art and helped establish two art schools in Indianapolis, but she did not begin to paint seriously until she was over forty years old.  Born to a pioneering Indiana family, Ketcham became a painter and teacher.  She was one of eighteen women who in 1883 founded the Art Association of Indianapolis which became the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Herron School of Art and Design.  She organized the artwork for the Art Association\u2019s first exhibition and hired faculty to open the school.  For the first year, she taught at the school and took summer trips in the U. S. and Europe.  As a middle-aged woman, Ketcham enrolled in the Art Students League in New York and was elected a life member.  She studied with William Merritt Chase and became godmother to his son.  New York was the focus of her life, and she became involved with the Art Students League.  In the summers, she went to Ogunquit, Maine to paint seascapes and teach summer classes. Ketcham probably painted this young woman during her first year of study with William Merritt Chase in New York.  Its dark, warm tones and freely brushed manner betray the Munich School\u2019s influence, which she absorbed through Chase.  The painting\u2019s title suggests the importance the artist placed upon the sweeping dark oval form of the woman\u2019s large hat. Its shape and color contrast with the delicate neckline of the lace-edged blouse.", "J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.  Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region\u2019s artists.  In 1898, Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901, Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from 1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.     Brookville, just a few miles southwest of Indianapolis, was far removed from the bustle of the city.  Although only a small town in Morgan County, it was easily accessible by railroad.  Local historians do not remember the exact location of Thornberry\u2019s pasture.  In this picturesque view of an autumn afternoon, Adams achieves the impressionist goal of capturing the light and atmosphere of a specific moment.  The setting sun leaves the foreground landscape in deep shadow, the grassy terrain dappled with sunlight, and the middle ground fully engulfed in a flowing autumnal light.  Adams uses a vertical canvas to place a strong emphasis on the trees that blanket the blue sky with their orange foliage.", "Robert Weaver was born in Peru, Indiana and attended the Herron School of art in Indianapolis where he received a Bachelor of Fine Art degree in painting.  He studied Fresco painting techniques at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. Weaver traveled to Mexico and Europe.  He maintained a studio in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village for two years.  He was the young painter to be awarded the Julius Halgarten for a circus painting shown at the Annual National Academy of design exhibition in New York City.  He also exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, The Corcoran Biennial, the Carnegie International and the San Francisco World\u2019s Fair.  After returning to Indiana, Weaver served as foreman in a machine company until he received a commission in the U. S. Navy.  He retired from the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant and a year later joined the faculty of the Herron School of Art where he taught painting, mural design, drawing and illustration. Weaver was president of the Circus City Festival, Inc. and piloted a beautification program known as \u201cOperation Facelift\u201d in Peru, Indiana for which he was voted \u201cMan of the Year.\u201d Weaver\u2019s Peru birthplace was the winter home to most of America\u2019s great circuses.  He spent his free time around circus people and took a job as a ticket taker at a sideshow, so he could become a part of the world he had grown to love.  His favorite painting subject was circus life.  In Circus Poster, a large brick home sits in the distance snow-covered landscape, while a dilapidated wood building is set in the foreground.  The bare trees and darkened sky give the scene an eerie quality.  The circular roadway surrounding the building draws attention to it and its torn circus poster.  The yellow arrow road sign seems to suggest the circus is to the viewer\u2019s right.", "William Henry Hilliard was born in Auburn, New York.  He moved to Madison, Indiana and ten years later to Indianapolis. Before arriving in Indiana, Hilliard was a sailor, a landscape painter in the West, and an art student in Chicago, where he lost all of his work in the Great fire of 1871. Hilliard left Indiana after 1876 and studied and worked in Europe, primarily England, Scotland and France. Hilliard was known for his New England landscapes and coastal scenes, which resemble the Hudson River School in their romantic realism. Sometime after returning to New York from Europe Hilliard added floral subjects to his landscape work. Hilliard ultimately settled in Washington, D. C.    This small painting of roses is among the most sophisticated works produced in Indiana during the early 1870s.  It displays Hilliard\u2019s fluid brushwork and his subtle control of the contrast of light and dark tonalities.  The slightly unbalanced, casual arrangement of the flowers suggests Hilliard was aware of Japanese design.  Japanese art played a significant role in late nineteenth-century European and American painting.", "George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Winter is also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians and later became the wife of the tribe\u2019s chief.  Winter\u2019s early training in England exposed him to the traditional pastoral, classically inspired landscapes modeled after the work of 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain.  Although this canvas purportedly depicts a view of the Wabash River near Lafayette, the graceful trees that frame the foreground, the measured recession of space, and the warm, dusky light suggest that it is a thoroughly idealized scene. Landscapes that partially transformed the untamed Indiana countryside into an orderly, ideal world probably appealed to Winter\u2019s purchasers.", "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute.

In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds. Situated between the German towns of Dachau and Schleissheim, the Dachau Moor was a favorite painting spot for Steele and Forsyth.  It offered a serene landscape where the Hoosier artists could spend undisturbed hours sketching and painting.  Here in the dwindling late afternoon light, Steele captures the essence of the quiet scene.  In this richly r=textured landscape, the thick areas of white suggest reflections from the sun\u2019s descending rays on the rippling water. The sense of solitude is broken only by the two peasant women fathering reeds in the dimly lit landscape.  Painted near the end of his stay in Munich, the dark, gray-green tonality of Late Afternoon is a legacy of Steele\u2019s academic training.", "Donald Mattison was born in Beloit, Wisconsin.  He attended Yale University where he received a bachelor of fine arts degree.  Mattison moved to Chicago to work as an assistant for the muralist Eugene Savage. Although he produced notable murals and paintings of figures and landscapes, Mattison turned to portraiture later in his career.  He won the Prix de Rome in 1928, a scholarship for art students that provided the opportunity to study abroad.  Mattison spent the next three years in Europe, where he was a fellow at the American Academy in Rome.  After his fellowship ended, Mattison moved back to America where he taught at New York University, Columbia University and the New York School of Design.  In 1933, he was offered a permanent full-time position as the Dean of John Herron Art School in Indianapolis, where he also continued to teach.  Mattison\u2019s art is rooted in the classical tradition.  He worked primarily in oil to capture the pleasant aspects of life, including landscapes, community celebrations, and children at play.   His 150 portraits included, U. S. Supreme Court Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sherman Minton, Indiana Governors Paul McNutt and Harold W. Handley, author Booth Tarkington, and the former president of the New York Stock Exchange Emil Schram.  Carnival, which should have been a lighthearted subject, is enveloped in an eerie darkness that hangs over the amusement park like an ominous cloud.  The man wearing a white, costume-like robe and playing a violin is more reminiscent of a beggar than a clown.  The viewer cannot see the faces of the two women walking toward the stairs and the people at the bottom of the steps are barely visible in the dim light.  Mattison may have intended to paint a happy event, but the uncertainties of the Depression have clearly found their way onto his canvas.", "Otto Stark was born in Indianapolis and apprenticed at the age of twelve to lithography.  At age sixteen, he studied at the Art Academy of Cincinnati and then entered the Art Students League of New York.  He later went to Paris where he continued his studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and became a member of the Soci\u00e9te des Beaux Arts et Belles Lettres.  He exhibited twice at the Paris Salon, the International Exhibition of Art and History in Rome and the Panama Pacific Exhibition, where he was in charge of the Indiana Exhibition.  For twenty years, Stark was the head of the Art Department of Emmerich Manual Training High School and an instructor in composition at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis. He was one of the five members of the Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, J. Ottis Adams, T. C. Steele, William Forsyth and Richard Gruelle. Stark took up residence in New York City, after completing his training in Paris.  When his wife died, he came back to his native Indiana.  A Summer Morning was painted while Stark was visiting the Hermitage, J. Ottis Adams\u2019 Brookville home.  It portrays the artist\u2019s eldest daughter Gretchen, seated in shade with her back to sunlit lawn, engrossed in her needlework. This solidly painted figure, posed against a loosely constructed landscape, exemplifies the American Impressionist style.", "J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing.

During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as Brookville.     This study of a half-draped man was probably painted during the two years Adams spent in Professor L\u00f6fftz\u2019s Technical Painting Class.  The unidealized figure sits in a dramatically lit interior, animated by contrasts of light and dark.  A thread of light describes the contour of the model and catches in its aura the smallest nuances of hair on the head, chin, chest, arms, and back.  These effects can result only from the closest and most time consuming study.  Such labor was expected of the students in L\u00f6fftz\u2019s painting class.", "Constance Coleman Richardson grew up in Irvington, Indiana, where her father was director of the Indiana State Historical Commission.  After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education.  The compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston Richardson.  After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years.  After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the Pennsylvania Academy.  During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects.  Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums. Richardson\u2019s love of the landscape is apparent in Hot Sun.  Here strong contrasts of bright sunlight intermingle with dark shadows, and lush green foliage. The dominant tree   is stippled with light that peaks through its dark leaves. Rocks and tree stumps add a rustic element to this serene landscape, while the houses in the distance and the young boy seated on the stone wall add a human touch.  Everything in this composition suggests a peaceful coexistence between people and nature.", "Thomas Glessing was born in London, but settled in America when he was twenty years old.  He was best known for his theatrical scenery and landscapes.  Glessing also decorated the interior of Old Fellows Hall in Indianapolis and was commissioned to paint a series of large canvases that illustrate the city\u2019s history for the first Indiana exposition in 1873.  Glessing left Indianapolis in 1873 to accept a position as scenic painter at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. In 1859, at the time Glessing painted Landscape with Figures, he was in Indianapolis decorating the Metropolitan Theatre.  Glessing\u2019s landscape shows the influence of Indiana artist Jacob Cox as well as knowledge of his English heritage.  His inclusion of figures turns this romantic landscape into a genre scene that is reminiscent of the Holy Family, complete with manger, mother and child, Joseph and John.", "Wayman Adams was born on a farm near Muncie Indiana to a Quaker father who was a livestock breeder and amateur artist. Adams\u2019 father encouraged his interest in art.  The first portrait commission the young boy received was a picture of a heifer named \u201cGypsy Girl III\u201d for which he was paid five dollars.  In 1904 Adams began his art education at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he spent four years studying under William Forsyth.  In 1910 Adams traveled with William Merritt Chase and his students to study art in Italy.  A few years later he made a similar trip to Spain with Robert Henri.  Adams\u2019 developed a style of \u201calla-prima\u201d painting, which means \u201call at once,\u201d is a method of painting in which the work is completed in one sitting, usually without the use of glazing or underpainting.  These rapidly painted works contain energetic brushwork and bold, expressive images.  Adams was an extremely prolific painter whose subjects included U. S. presidents, university leaders, authors, artists, society ladies, actors and actresses, military heroes, sports personalities, musicians, royalty, and governors.  \u201cAt one point in his career, Adams had studios in Indianapolis New York City and Philadelphia.  During the winter he traveled extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects.  In terms of awards and honors, Adams may be Herron\u2019s most successful alumnus, winning prizes in most of the major national competitions during his 60-year career.  This portrait of the conductor of the Indianapolis Orchestra, Alexander Ernestinoff, won the Proctor Prize at the National Academy of Design in 1914 and vaulted Adams into the ranks of the country\u2019s leading portraitists.  The flowing brushwork reveals the influence of Adams\u2019 principal teacher at Herron, William Forsyth, as well as his instruction in New York with the American masters of bravura painting, Robert Henri and William Merritt Chase.  In keeping with Chase and Henri\u2019s method of rapid execution, Adams is reported to have completed the Ernestinoff likeness in just three hours.  According to Adams\u2019 account of the sitting, Ernestinoff came into the studio and casually dropped into a chair, still wearing his hat and overcoat.  The relaxed pose so appealed to Adams\u2019 love of the spontaneous that it became the basis for the portrait.", "William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city\u2019s Royal Academy.  In 1878, Chase returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style.  He was a member of America\u2019s influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely influential teacher.  Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in Shinnecock, Long Island.  He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Charles Sheeler. When Chase painted this portrait of his grandfather, he was no more than eighteen years old and Moses Swaim just over seventy.  Young Chase had only recently begun studying with Indianapolis artist Barton Hays, but his likeness convincingly portrays the rugged features and earnest expression of this agricultural pioneer.  The tightly brushed portrait is one of Chase\u2019s earliest canvases. It descended in the artist\u2019s family, surviving a house fire and a long period in a Kansas drug store.  When it entered the IMA, the image was marred by soot, small holes and an improperly fitted frame.  After treatment in the museum\u2019s laboratory and careful reframing, Chase\u2019s grandfather now reveals the startlingly early prowess of his portraiture.", "Henrik Mayer was born in Nashua, New Hampshire and took his art training at the Manchester Institute of Arts and the Yale School of Fine Art.  He studied in Europe as a Winchester Fellow before accepting a teaching position in New York City where he also served as designer and decorator of the New York Cosmopolitan Club.  In 1934, Mayer moved to Indianapolis where he became assistant director under Donald Mattison at the Herron Art School.   During this period, Mayer exhibited his paintings at the Hoosier Salon, Herron Art Institute, Art Institute of Chicago, Corcoran Gallery Biennial, and the National Academy of Design where he won a prize.  He also accepted mural commissions at such places as the post office building in Lafayette, Indiana.  In 1946, Mayer moved to Essex, Connecticut, where he became director of the Hartford Art School of the Wadsworth Athenaeum. He later became dean of the Art School of the University of Harford in Connecticut and also served as director of the Wadsworth Athenaeum.  The depression-era mural projects of the Works Progress Administration probably influenced Mayer\u2019s choice of grand-scale designs, and although he may never have intended Halloween Carnival to become a mural, it looks as if it could be a section of an enormous panorama of Halloween revelers.  According to the artist\u2019s wife, Mayer\u2019s painting was inspired by Halloween celebrations that were once held on Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis.", "Grant Christian was born in Edinburgh, Indiana and attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.  While in art school, Christian entered numerous art competitions which were offered through the government\u2019s New Deal program and was selected as a mural artist for the old Indianapolis post office and the Nappanee, Indiana post office.  Christian spent most of his career as a commercial illustrator and held art directorships and executive positions in several advertising firms.  In 1936, Christian was the recipient of the Hoosier Salon\u2019s Thomas Meek Butler Prize for his landscape, The Edge of Town.  The painting was highly praised in the local newspaper as an example of how a railroad track and an unsightly dump can be transformed into a \u201cthing of beauty by means of sunlight and radiant atmosphere \u2013 and by an artist\u2019s poetic touch.\u201d", "Wayman Adams was born on a farm near Muncie Indiana to a Quaker father who was a livestock breeder and amateur artist.

During the winter he traveled extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects.  The Art Jury, which depicts T C. Steele, Otto, Stark, J. Ottis Adams, and William Forsyth, the Hoosier Group artists who were Adams\u2019 first teachers in Indiana, exemplifies the Adams\u2019 group portraits.  This realistic view of his mentors shows them judging works of art.  Each portrait is carefully constructed to express the artists\u2019 personalities, demeanor and facial features.  The portrait even shows Forsyth smoking, Stark with a cane and the signature beards worn by the men.  It is one of the few group images of the members of the Hoosier Group that depicts their likenesses with such accuracy. The only missing member, Richard Gruelle, died before the work was painted. The Indianapolis Museum of Art has more than fifty works by Wayman Adams in its American collection.  Many of these are portraits of famous Indiana residents. Included in this group are the author Booth Tarkington, the poet James Whitcomb Riley, the pharmaceutical giant, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., the artist Randolph Coats and the local art dealer Carl Herman Lieber.", "Clifton Wheeler was born in Hadley, Indiana, but his family moved to Mooresville when he was a child.  Later Wheeler met William Forsyth who gave him encouragement and technical guides.  Wheeler went to New York City and studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri and Kenneth Hayes Miller.  His fellow classmates included Ge3orge Bellows Edward Hopper and guy P\u00e8ne DuBois.  He traveled to Italy with Chase\u2019s painting class and later to Paris and became friends with Gertrude Stein and Pablo Picasso.  Although he was urged to stay in New York, Wheeler returned home to Indiana where he taught for many years at the Herrron Art Institute and Butler University.  In the summer he taught at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  He painted in North Carolina, Michigan, Tennessee and Upstate New York capturing scenes of the Black, Smoky, Rocky and Catskill Mountains as well as the dunes on Lake Michigan.  Wheeler painted in an impressionist style with a strong sense of color and design. Wheeler probably painted In the Catskills near the artists\u2019 colony at Woodstock, New York.  The staccato pattern of blocky brushstrokes, reminiscent of Forsyth\u2019s landscape technique, enhances the sense of nature in movement.  Wheeler\u2019s design, based on a grid, reinforces the serenity of the woodland view.", "John Washington Love arrived in Indianapolis with his parents when he was ten years old.  After studying in the public schools and Northwestern Christian University, Love decided to become an artist.  He entered the studio of Barton Hays and later went to Cincinnati to continue his studies.  After a year he went to New York and entered the School of the National Academy of Design.  He then traveled to Paris and was the first Indiana artist to enter the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the At\u00e9lier G\u00e9r\u00f4me where he studied for four years.  After six years of European study, Love return to Indianapolis and set up the first Indiana School of Art with fellow artist James F. Gookins. Love\u2019s promising career was cut short with his death at the age of thirty. After Love returned from study in France, his interest in landscape painting continued.  The influence of the French Barbizon painters is apparent in the dark tones and the loose, broken brushstrokes that sweep across the canvas.  In this Indianapolis landscape scene, the tradition of the Barbizon painters is mingled with Love\u2019s own individual style", "Jacob Dunn, a native of Indiana and the son of a state treasurer, decided to enter the Indianapolis studio of Jacob Cox in 1840.  After a short period of art training, he took up medicine and received a degree from a college in Cincinnati.  Other than his appointment as an assistant surgeon in the Mexican Ware, it is not known to what extent Dunn practiced medicine.  He was listed among the painters of Indianapolis in the spring of 1851.  During the first few months Jacob Cox was in Cincinnati he and Dunn had a studio together.  Dunn, whose early death Jacob Cox attributed to excessive drinking, ironically chose the Temperance Pledge as the subject for this painting.  It represents a man who hesitates before signing the pledge, while his wife encourages him and the devil offers him a glass of liquor.  The man\u2019s mended coat and frayed collar and shirt make his poverty painfully obvious, while the redness of his face suggests that what little money he did have was being spent on liquor.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in separate ferry accidents.  Cox\u2019s grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians.  By that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox\u2019s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.  Cox often modeled his landscapes after the calm, pastoral views of Hudson River school painters, such as Asher B. Durand. Landscape near Indianapolis may depict a stretch of Fall Creek north of the city, an area Cox frequently painted.  The three figures in the lower left could be a family about to begin the arduous transformation from the frontier into the orderly Indiana farmland pictured in the distance.  The bridge in the composition\u2019s center reinforces the idea of transition from wilderness to productive land.  Cox\u2019s soft brushwork and saturated pastel palette convey a sense of optimism about life in Indiana in the 1860s.", "Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in Franklin, Indiana.  He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich\u2019s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States, where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of forty-three. Richards completed his training at the Royal Academy in 1887, but unlike the other Hoosier artists, he showed no interest in landscape painting or any inclination to return to Indiana in the near future.  Instead, he entered the mainstream of professional figure painting in Munich.  This portrait, presumed to be the artist\u2019s Munich-born daughter Gretchen, epitomizes all the richness of detail and formality associated with Munich realism.  Gretchen is posed in profile against an unadorned background.  Her hair and facial features are executed with exquisite detail.  Richards\u2019 use of dark tonalities is in keeping with his Munich training, but the delicate pink scarf relieves the starkness of the composition.", "Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.  Hays drew on barn walls with charcoal and saw his first oil painting at age twenty.  He moved to northern Indiana, where after painting portraits of family and friends, he began accepting portrait commissions to earn a living.  In 1858, Hays moved to Indianapolis, where he became a partner in a photography firm.  He tinted photographs and painted over enlarged prints.  Hays was one of the first art teachers in Indianapolis. Among his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.  Much of his renown came from his ability to convince Chase\u2019s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.  Hays was successful in receiving the commission to paint governor William Harrison\u2019s portrait.  He was one of the original members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Hay\u2019s likeness of Dr. Lyons is typical of early American portraits.  The seated half-length figure is placed against a plain background.  His hands and face are emphasized by contrasting the skin tones and the white shirt against the dark setting.  Facial features are carefully rendered in firm brushstrokes.  The sitter holds a book on his lap as a symbol of higher learning and his own accomplishments.", "Floyd Hopper was born in Martin County, Indiana.  After graduating from West Baden High School in 1929, Hopper attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, graduating in 1933.  Hopper was the founder of the Noblesville Casting Company as well as an artist who painted watercolor landscapes, commissioned portraits and the American scene with its backyards, alleyways, city streets and workers. He also taught fine art at the Herron Art School and the Art League. Hopper painted Blue Monday the same year he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Herron.  The painting\u2019s title almost certainly refers to the gloomy mood Hopper achieved in his depiction of a backyard in a rural community at the end of the Depression. Hopper\u2019s use of color powerfully evokes the harsh quality of the scene.  A pale, dead yellow covers the dried grass and weathered buildings, shadows are painted in the brown color of used motor oil, and the sky is a smear of smoky tones.  Echoing the blank faces of the men and women is the blank face of the house in the left background.", "Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his father\u2019s business failed, the family moved to Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi and the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. Whether in Paris, Venice, or Boston, Prendergast was attracted to the vivid parade of everyday life. He became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who included Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William Glackens.  Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat areas of boldly contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have been described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight, Prendergast favored people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Until 1904 he worked almost exclusively in watercolor. Prendergast earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors and later oils depicting bustling crowds. Prendergast is one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of C\u00e9zanne and turn them into his personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  His brother Charles was an important frame maker whose frames can often be seen on his brother\u2019s work. Prendergast translated the bustling activity of busy park scenes or passing crowds into flat, bold areas of percolating color arranged like a loosely knit tapestry of contrasting shapes and forms.  While his technique became progressively decorative, Prendergast\u2019s themes remained consistent.  The site for Park Salem  is believed to be a marine park near Salem, Massachusetts.", "Robert Davidson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and apprenticed to his artist-father.  He studied sculpture at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, The Art Institute of Chicago, the School of American Sculpture in New York City, and the Bavarian Fine Arts Academy in Munich Germany.  Davidson\u2019s wife, Maryetta, was an Indiana ceramics artist and also a graduate of John Herron Art Institute.  The couple moved to Saratoga Spring New York where Davidson taught art at Skidmore College.  During his career, Davidson was a member of the Indiana Artists Club and the Chicago Artist Association.  The best know of Davidson\u2019s early commissions are large concrete plaques that decorate the fa\u00e7ade of Indianapolis\u2019 Shortridge High School.  Praying Angel was one of several pieces Davidson placed in national exhibitions during the 1920s.  The bust\u2019s symmetry, spiritual intensity, and even the limestone material recall the statuary of Gothic Cathedrals.", "Joseph Mason was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and attended John James Audubon\u2019s classes in drawing in Cincinnati.  He traveled with Audubon on a flatboat to New Orleans and drew at least fifty flowers for Audubon\u2019s bird paintings.  Upon his return to Cincinnati and without further training, Mason became a portrait artist.  In 1834, he left Cincinnati and painted portraits in Michigan and Indiana.  He died of pneumonia at age thirty-four. The portrait of Marie Jane Andrew, age, 7, was commissioned in memory of the girl soon after she died.  She is dressed in an elaborate early Victorian costume and seated among the objects of her childhood; a sewing box, school books, treasured sea shells, and a Staffordshire pottery figure of a dog.  In addition to offering a wealth of information about the decorative arts of the period, this portrait is an excellent example of a self-trained professional portrait artist working in the nineteenth century.  Mason had difficulty rendering such simple objects as a book, a table top, and a chair in proper perspective.  The little girl\u2019s extremities, too, are less than convincing.  The artist\u2019s sense of composition and design makes up for any shortcomings in technique.  The piping on the child\u2019s dress creates an interesting play of lines with the gold chain about her neck; the window encasements direct the viewer\u2019s eye to her head, the focal point of the picture.  The portrait is an interesting example of a picture within a picture.  The painting of a boy in the upper left is believed to be the girl\u2019s brother, James, who had also died very young.  The distant landscape, seen from the window, is probably their familyl home.", "John Washington Love arrived in Indianapolis with his parents when he was ten years old.  After studying in the public schools and Northwestern Christian University, Love decided to become an artist.  He entered the studio of Barton Hays and later went to Cincinnati to continue his studies.  After a year he went to New York and entered the School of the National Academy of Design.

After six years of European study, Love return to Indianapolis and set up the first Indiana School of Art with fellow artist James F. Gookins. Love\u2019s promising career was cut short with his death at the age of thirty. Love\u2019s study of a young boy shows a looser brushwork and more spontaneous approach than that of earlier figure paintings.  Love\u2019s casual, informal treatment is particularly apparent in the boy\u2019s sidelong glance.  His white collar bring our his facial features that would otherwise be lost in the dark background.", "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in separate ferry accidents.  Cox\u2019s grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians.  By that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of sixteen.

When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.  Farmyard Scene displays an unqualified enthusiasm for the vitality, bounty, and sheer visual appeal of rural life.  Cox continually searched for themes that would appeal to Midwestern patrons, and images of prosperity derived from working the land must have been popular subjects.  The European style of the architecture in Farmyard Scene suggests that Cox was probably inspired by Dutch and English painting.  Perhaps he was striving to elevate the familiar barnyard scenery through associations with Old World culture.  In this canvas Cox gave prominence to the natural beauty and vigor of the animals and relegated the two women and the buildings to the shadowed areas of the scene.", "Joseph Oriel Eaton was born in Newark, Ohio.  At the age of sixteen he traveled to Indianapolis and entered the studio of Jacob Cox.  He moved to Cincinnati and then took a trip to Europe and finally settled in New York, where he set up his own studio. During his time in Cincinnati Eaton became a very popular portrait artist.  In New York he developed a reputation as a skillful painter of women\u2019s portraits.  When William Merritt Chase arrived in New York, he was referred to Eaton for assistance in pursuit of his art career.  Eaton was an associate member of the National Academy of design and a member of the Water Color Society and Artists\u2019 Fund Society.  Although he painted landscapes and a few neoclassical pieces, Eaton is best known for his portraits and his free brushwork and sensitive approach. In the Portrait of Amelia Studley Eaton\u2019s brushstroke appears loose, but the drawing of the sitter\u2019s face remains firm and solid.  He emphasizes the sitter\u2019s facial features by placing her against a plain background frames her through the use of a curtain and the fabric on the back of her chair. To move the viewer around the canvases he repeats the red of the curtain in the woman\u2019s dress and the cloth behind her.  These techniques were used by many successful nineteenth century portrait painters.", "Cecil Head was born near Lebanon, Indiana and graduated from the John Herron Art Institute.  He later shared a studio with Floyd Hopper and William Kaiser in the Old Union Trust Building on Market Street in Indianapolis.  The group became known as the Market Street Artists. Early in his career, Head was a recipient of many art awards including the J. I. Holcomb Prize from the Indianapolis Art Association and the Ross J. Beatty Prize from the Hoosier Salon.  He was one of the artists selected by Wilbur Peat, director of the John Herron Art Institute, to represent Indiana in a nationwide exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D. C. After a short time constructing airplane components during World War II, Head settled into a dual career as a commercial artist and farmer. Views of railroad tracks, factories and backs of houses were common subjects for many American painters during the first half of the twentieth-century.  Some artists chose such subjects to portray the social inequities and the grim ugliness that were part of modern urban life.  Although Buildings in Winter depicts an alley in a working-class Indianapolis neighborhood, the artist has stated that he was more interested in achieving a strong composition and rich color scheme than in making a social statement.  Head organized the blocky, geometric shapes of the buildings into a solid triangle, implied by the convergence of the stairs on the left and the slope of the roofs on the right. Buildings in Winter was exhibited at the 1939 New York World\u2019s Fair.", "Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.

He was one of the original members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Although Hays is best known for his portraits he also excelled at still life painting. Strawberries exemplifies the artist\u2019s use of strong contrasts of light and dark to enhance the fruit.  He often incorporated a basket from which the strawberries spilled.  The texture of the berry and the delicacy of its leaves are superbly captured by Hays who used his  skill to create a realistic image of this lush fruit.", "Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.

The Sewells, residents of Covington, Indiana, were painted using the dark tonalities and unadorned background typically found in nineteenth-century portraiture.  The meticulous rendering of the sitters\u2019 glasses, the careful delineation of William Sewell\u2019s thinning hair and full beard and Eusebia Sewell\u2019s delicate lace collar with its prominent cameo pin exemplify the quality and attention to detail typical of Hays\u2019 portrait style.", "Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.

C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana\u2019s most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds. Schliersee, a resort tucked into the Alps thirty-eight rail miles southeast of Munich, was a favorite vacation spot for the Steele family.  From the shores of Schliersee Lake, Steele depicts the picturesque quality of the town.  Framed by sea and sky, the landscape of farms, cottages and churches is echoed in the water\u2019s reflections.  The boat placed to the left of the village provides the necessary balance to complete the carefully constructed composition.", "A Pennsylvania native, Katherine Wagenhals studied at Smith College and at the Art Students League in New York and at the Acad\u00e9mie Moderne in Paris before making her way to Fort Wayne, Indiana. There she may have taught t the Fort Wayne School of Art with her talented relatives the printmakers Jessie and Norah Hamilton.  This prim lady in a blue suit and rather assertive bonnet won Wagenhals the Art Association of Indianapolis Purchase Prize in 1916. Although the genteel setting falls within the tradition of interiors painted by the Boston School artists, the thick, simple strokes used to suggest the visitor\u2019s hands show Wagenhals\u2019 familiarity with bolder painting styles.  The tidy background of straight lines and 90 degree angles reinforces the impression of propriety.  If not for the sitter\u2019s intelligent expression and alert bearing, the door in the background might be interpreted as a symbol of a highly desired departure rather than a welcome arrival.", "Very little is written about Dewey Bates\u2019 life and career.  He was born in Philadelphia and received his art training in Antwerp, Paris and London.  His move to Indiana was probably influenced by his Indianapolis relatives and his friendship with John Washington Love, who had been a fellow student in Paris. Both artists arrived in Indianapolis in 1876. Bates and Love, along with James Gookins helped establish the first Indiana School of Art in 1877. The school was short-lived and closed after only two years.  The friendship between Bates and Love is apparent in the inscription on this portrait which reads, \u201ca mon ami, John Love\u201d (to my friend, John Love).  Bates places his subject in a room that is probably an artist\u2019s studio, possible part of the newly formed Indiana School of Art. The sitter\u2019s casual pose is enhanced by his outdoor attire and posture and the dog that sits beside the chair gazing up at him."]}]}, "context": {"version": 3, "page_title": null, "page_url": null, "entities": [], "literals": [], "content_hierarchy": []}}
