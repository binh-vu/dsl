In 1897, she gave a large part of her collection to the museum at the University of Pennsylvania (now the University Museum).

Swaying under the weight of her pail and squinting into the sun, she presents the ideal of natural womanhood. Her powerful presence, marked by broad shoulders, muscular arms, and sunburned skin, counters the farmhand's relaxed stance and shaded face, visually reversing traditional gender roles. Far from flirting, the two figures awkwardly avoid each other's gaze, modeling rural wholesomeness and rectitude.", "Henry Benbridge's scene, which derives from the Greek epic tradition on the Trojan War, is one of the most baroque compositions painted in the Delaware Valley during the eighteenth century. The painting is a copy, in reverse, of a tapestry design by Peter Paul Rubens (Flemish, 1577-1640). In the painting, Achilles has been disguised as a woman and hidden among the daughters of King Lycomedes at the behest of his mother, who knows that he is fated to die if he goes to Troy. Achilles betrays himself by showing too much interest in a helmet and becomes one of Greece's great warriors.", "Most of Eakins's paintings after 1886 were portraits, but he returned to sporting subjects in the late 1890s with a series that he began after attending professional boxing matches at the Philadelphia Arena (then located at the intersection of Broad and Cherry Streets, diagonally across from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts).

In this scene set in the Adirondack region of New York State, earthen colors link the hunter and the environment, making it difficult to distinguish the man from the hill behind him. Homer visited the Adirondacks as one of many vacationers who flocked there in the late nineteenth century. The huntsman in Homers painting is not a visitor but rather a local trapper or guide who has caught a deer and is carrying off its pelt, antlers, and, likely, a pack full of meat.", "Philadelphia art critic Christian Brinton---who donated his extensive collection of modern paintings, sculptures, graphic arts, costumes, and textiles to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1941---was a major advocate of Philadelphia-area artists.

Proclaiming that her new dress is not good enough, he threatens the tailor. Katharina's atypical composure suggests Petruchio's success in  taming  her temper. Best known for biblical history pictures, romantic portraits, and landscapes, Allston was also a poet and novelist. His interest in Shakespeare undoubtedly was stimulated by his close friendship with Shakespearean scholar Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Not long before this picture was painted, the two men had toured Italy, where Allston learned to emulate the lustrous glazes and jewel-like colors of Venetian painting.", "Enoch Edwards (17511802) was a Philadelphian who trained as a physician and served as a surgeon in the Continental Army (the colonial army formed during the American Revolutionary War). This group portrait commemorates his marriage to the half-sister of Henry Benbridge, who painted the scene. Benbridge depicts himself, along with Dr. Edwardss sister, on the couples left, clothing the bride in a luxurious form of imaginary dress employed by many eighteenth-century artists. Benbridge had traveled to Rome and London to study but returned to his native Philadelphia in 1770.

Secured firmly to ship and shore, the device permitted the transfer of stranded passengers to safety by means of a pulley that was hauled back and forth by crews at either end. Cropped down to its essentials, Homer's composition thrusts us into the midst of the action with massive waves rolling past, drenching the semiconscious woman and her anonymous savior.", "A tiny ship on the horizon is dwarfed by the breakers beating the shoreline near Homers studio in Maine.", "Transatlantic travel looks like fun in Homers recollection of his own trip to France in 186667. Stylish passengers stroll the deck, read, doze, uncork bottles, and inspect the marine life via telescope, seemingly unfazed by the steep tilt of their vulnerable, wooden world. Employed as an illustrator of topics from modern life, Homer had a sharp eye for fashion, leisure activity, and pretty girls. He envisions a bachelors paradise, where attractive young women abound and flirtatious winds expose a well-turned ankle.", "American Rockingham wares were popular in the Unites States from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries. The term  Rockingham  derives from an English factory on the estate of the Marquess of Rockingham that produced ceramic objects from 1745 until 1842.
